# 1290. Convert Binary Number in a Linked List to Integer

Given ```head``` which is a reference node to a singly-linked list. The value of each node in the linked list is either 0 or 1. The linked list holds the binary representation of a number.

Return the decimal value of the number in the linked list.

**Example1:**

```
Input: head = [1,0,1]
Output: 5
Explanation: (101) in base 2 = (5) in base 10
```

**Example2:**
```
Input: head = [0]
Output: 0
```

**Example3:**
```
Input: head = [1]
Output: 1
```

**Example4:**
```
Input: head = [1,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0]
Output: 18880
```

**Example5:**
```
Input: head = [0,0]
Output: 0
```

**Constraints:**
- The Linked List is not empty.
- Number of nodes will not exceed 30.
- Each node's value is either 0 or 1.
