## 5. Longest Palindromic Substring

Given a string s, find the longest palindromic substring in s. You may assume that the maximum length of s is 1000.

Example 1:
```
Input: "babad"
Output: "bab"
Note: "aba" is also a valid answer.
```

Example 2:
```
Input: "cbbd"
Output: "bb"
```

Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    string longestPalindrome(string s) {
        
    }
};
```

## 53. Maximum Subarray

Given an integer array nums, find the contiguous subarray (containing at least one number) which has the largest sum and return its sum.

Example:
```
Input: [-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4],
Output: 6
Explanation: [4,-1,2,1] has the largest sum = 6.
```
Follow up:

If you have figured out the O(n) solution, try coding another solution using the divide and conquer approach, which is more subtle.

Solution:

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxSubArray(vector<int>& nums) {
        
    }
};
```

## 121. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock

Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.

If you were only permitted to complete at most one transaction (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock), design an algorithm to find the maximum profit.

Note that you cannot sell a stock before you buy one.

Example 1:
```
Input: [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
             Not 7-1 = 6, as selling price needs to be larger than buying price.
```

Example 2:
```
Input: [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.
```

Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxProfit(vector<int>& prices) {
        
    }
};
```

## 85. Maximal Rectangle

Given a 2D binary matrix filled with 0's and 1's, find the largest rectangle containing only 1's and return its area.

Example:
```
Input:
[
  ["1","0","1","0","0"],
  ["1","0","1","1","1"],
  ["1","1","1","1","1"],
  ["1","0","0","1","0"]
]
Output: 6
```

Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maximalRectangle(vector<vector<char>>& matrix) {
        
    }
};
```

## 10. Regular Expression Matching

Given an input string (s) and a pattern (p), implement regular expression matching with support for '.' and '*'.
```
'.' Matches any single character.
'*' Matches zero or more of the preceding element.
```
The matching should cover the entire input string (not partial).

Note:

- s could be empty and contains only lowercase letters a-z.
- p could be empty and contains only lowercase letters a-z, and characters like . or *.

Example 1:
```
Input:
s = "aa"
p = "a"
Output: false
Explanation: "a" does not match the entire string "aa".
```
Example 2:
```
Input:
s = "aa"
p = "a*"
Output: true
Explanation: '*' means zero or more of the preceding element, 'a'. 
Therefore, by repeating 'a' once, it becomes "aa".
```
Example 3:
```
Input:
s = "ab"
p = ".*"
Output: true
Explanation: ".*" means "zero or more (*) of any character (.)".
```
Example 4:
```
Input:
s = "aab"
p = "c*a*b"
Output: true
Explanation: c can be repeated 0 times, a can be repeated 1 time. 
Therefore, it matches "aab".
```

Example 5:
```
Input:
s = "mississippi"
p = "mis*is*p*."
Output: false
```

Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool isMatch(string s, string p) {
        
    }
};
```

## 312. Burst Balloons

Given n balloons, indexed from 0 to n-1. Each balloon is painted with a number on it represented by array nums. You are asked to burst all the balloons. If the you burst balloon i you will get nums[left] * nums[i] * nums[right] coins. Here left and right are adjacent indices of i. After the burst, the left and right then becomes adjacent.

Find the maximum coins you can collect by bursting the balloons wisely.

Note:

- You may imagine nums[-1] = nums[n] = 1. They are not real therefore you can not burst them.
- 0 ≤ n ≤ 500, 0 ≤ nums[i] ≤ 100

Example:

```
Input: [3,1,5,8]
Output: 167 
Explanation: nums = [3,1,5,8] --> [3,5,8] -->   [3,8]   -->  [8]  --> []
             coins =  3*1*5      +  3*5*8    +  1*3*8      + 1*8*1   = 167
```

Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxCoins(vector<int>& nums) {
        
    }
};
```

## 96. Unique Binary Search Trees

Example:
```
Input: 3
Output: 5
Explanation:
Given n = 3, there are a total of 5 unique BST's:

   1         3     3      2      1
    \       /     /      / \      \
     3     2     1      1   3      2
    /     /       \                 \
   2     1         2                 3
```

Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int numTrees(int n) {
        
    }
};
```

## 70. Climbing Stairs

You are climbing a stair case. It takes n steps to reach to the top.

Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?

Example 1:
```
Input: 2
Output: 2
Explanation: There are two ways to climb to the top.
1. 1 step + 1 step
2. 2 steps
```
Example 2:
```
Input: 3
Output: 3
Explanation: There are three ways to climb to the top.
1. 1 step + 1 step + 1 step
2. 1 step + 2 steps
3. 2 steps + 1 step
```

Constraints:

- 1 <= n <= 45

Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {

    }
};
```

## 198. House Robber

You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed, the only constraint stopping you from robbing each of them is that adjacent houses have security system connected and it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night.

Given a list of non-negative integers representing the amount of money of each house, determine the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight without alerting the police.

 

Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
Output: 4
Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 1) and then rob house 3 (money = 3).
             Total amount you can rob = 1 + 3 = 4.
```
Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [2,7,9,3,1]
Output: 12
Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 2), rob house 3 (money = 9) and rob house 5 (money = 1).
             Total amount you can rob = 2 + 9 + 1 = 12.
```

Constraints:

- 0 <= nums.length <= 100
- 0 <= nums[i] <= 400

Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int rob(vector<int>& nums) {
        
    }
};
```

## 139. Word Break

Given a non-empty string s and a dictionary wordDict containing a list of non-empty words, determine if s can be segmented into a space-separated sequence of one or more dictionary words.

Note:

The same word in the dictionary may be reused multiple times in the segmentation.
You may assume the dictionary does not contain duplicate words.

Example 1:
```
Input: s = "leetcode", wordDict = ["leet", "code"]
Output: true
Explanation: Return true because "leetcode" can be segmented as "leet code".
```
Example 2:
```
Input: s = "applepenapple", wordDict = ["apple", "pen"]
Output: true
Explanation: Return true because "applepenapple" can be segmented as "apple pen apple".
             Note that you are allowed to reuse a dictionary word.
```             
Example 3:
```
Input: s = "catsandog", wordDict = ["cats", "dog", "sand", "and", "cat"]
Output: false
```

Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool wordBreak(string s, vector<string>& wordDict) {
        
    }
};
```

## 72. Edit Distance

Given two words word1 and word2, find the minimum number of operations required to convert word1 to word2.

You have the following 3 operations permitted on a word:

Insert a character
Delete a character
Replace a character

Example 1:
```
Input: word1 = "horse", word2 = "ros"
Output: 3
Explanation: 
horse -> rorse (replace 'h' with 'r')
rorse -> rose (remove 'r')
rose -> ros (remove 'e')
```
Example 2:
```
Input: word1 = "intention", word2 = "execution"
Output: 5
Explanation: 
intention -> inention (remove 't')
inention -> enention (replace 'i' with 'e')
enention -> exention (replace 'n' with 'x')
exention -> exection (replace 'n' with 'c')
exection -> execution (insert 'u')
```
Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minDistance(string word1, string word2) {
        
    }
};
```

## 152. Maximum Product Subarray

Given an integer array nums, find the contiguous subarray within an array (containing at least one number) which has the largest product.

Example 1:
```
Input: [2,3,-2,4]
Output: 6
Explanation: [2,3] has the largest product 6.
```
Example 2:
```
Input: [-2,0,-1]
Output: 0
Explanation: The result cannot be 2, because [-2,-1] is not a subarray.
```

Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxProduct(vector<int>& nums) {
        
    }
};
```

## 1130. Minimum Cost Tree From Leaf Values

Given an array arr of positive integers, consider all binary trees such that:

- Each node has either 0 or 2 children;
- The values of arr correspond to the values of each leaf in an in-order traversal of the tree.  (Recall that a node is a leaf if and only if it has 0 children.)
- The value of each non-leaf node is equal to the product of the largest leaf value in its left and right subtree respectively.

Among all possible binary trees considered, return the smallest possible sum of the values of each non-leaf node.  It is guaranteed this sum fits into a 32-bit integer. 

Example 1:
```
Input: arr = [6,2,4]
Output: 32
Explanation:
There are two possible trees.  The first has non-leaf node sum 36, and the 
second has non-leaf node sum 32.

    24            24
   /  \          /  \
  12   4        6    8
 /  \               / \
6    2             2   4
```

Constraints:

- 2 <= arr.length <= 40
- 1 <= arr[i] <= 15
- It is guaranteed that the answer fits into a 32-bit signed integer (ie. it is less than 2^31).

Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int mctFromLeafValues(vector<int>& arr) {
        
    }
};
```

## 338. Counting Bits

Given a non negative integer number num. For every numbers i in the range 0 ≤ i ≤ num calculate the number of 1's in their binary representation and return them as an array.

Example 1:
```
Input: 2
Output: [0,1,1]
```
Example 2:
```
Input: 5
Output: [0,1,1,2,1,2]
```
Follow up:

- It is very easy to come up with a solution with run time O(n*sizeof(integer)). But can you do it in linear time O(n) /possibly in a single pass?
- Space complexity should be O(n).
- Can you do it like a boss? Do it without using any builtin function like __builtin_popcount in c++ or in any other language.

Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> countBits(int num) {
        
    }
};
```

## 279. Perfect Squares

Given a positive integer n, find the least number of perfect square numbers (for example, 1, 4, 9, 16, ...) which sum to n.

Example 1:
```
Input: n = 12
Output: 3 
Explanation: 12 = 4 + 4 + 4.
```
Example 2:
```
Input: n = 13
Output: 2
Explanation: 13 = 4 + 9.
```

Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int numSquares(int n) {
        
    }
};
```

## 120. Triangle

Given a triangle, find the minimum path sum from top to bottom. Each step you may move to adjacent numbers on the row below.

For example, given the following triangle
```
[
     [2],
    [3,4],
   [6,5,7],
  [4,1,8,3]
]
```
The minimum path sum from top to bottom is 11 (i.e., 2 + 3 + 5 + 1 = 11).

Note:

Bonus point if you are able to do this using only O(n) extra space, where n is the total number of rows in the triangle.

Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minimumTotal(vector<vector<int>>& triangle) {
        
    }
};
```

## 64. Minimum Path Sum

Given a m x n grid filled with non-negative numbers, find a path from top left to bottom right which minimizes the sum of all numbers along its path.

Note: You can only move either down or right at any point in time.

Example:
```
Input:
[
  [1,3,1],
  [1,5,1],
  [4,2,1]
]
Output: 7
Explanation: Because the path 1→3→1→1→1 minimizes the sum.
```

Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minPathSum(vector<vector<int>>& grid) {
        
    }
};
```

## 309. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock with Cooldown

Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.

Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete as many transactions as you like (ie, buy one and sell one share of the stock multiple times) with the following restrictions:

- You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (ie, you must sell the stock before you buy again).
- After you sell your stock, you cannot buy stock on next day. (ie, cooldown 1 day)

Example:
```
Input: [1,2,3,0,2]
Output: 3 
Explanation: transactions = [buy, sell, cooldown, buy, sell]
```

Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxProfit(vector<int>& prices) {
        
    }
};
```

## 1025. Divisor Game

Alice and Bob take turns playing a game, with Alice starting first.

Initially, there is a number N on the chalkboard.  On each player's turn, that player makes a move consisting of:

Choosing any x with 0 < x < N and N % x == 0.
Replacing the number N on the chalkboard with N - x.
Also, if a player cannot make a move, they lose the game.

Return True if and only if Alice wins the game, assuming both players play optimally.

Example 1:
```
Input: 2
Output: true
Explanation: Alice chooses 1, and Bob has no more moves.
```
Example 2:
```
Input: 3
Output: false
Explanation: Alice chooses 1, Bob chooses 1, and Alice has no more moves.
```

Note:

- 1 <= N <= 1000

Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool divisorGame(int N) {
        
    }
};
```

## 32. Longest Valid Parentheses

Given a string containing just the characters '(' and ')', find the length of the longest valid (well-formed) parentheses substring.

Example 1:
```
Input: "(()"
Output: 2
Explanation: The longest valid parentheses substring is "()"
```
Example 2:
```
Input: ")()())"
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest valid parentheses substring is "()()"
```

Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int longestValidParentheses(string s) {
        
    }
};
```

## 95. Unique Binary Search Trees II

Given an integer n, generate all structurally unique BST's (binary search trees) that store values 1 ... n.

Example:
```
Input: 3
Output:
[
  [1,null,3,2],
  [3,2,null,1],
  [3,1,null,null,2],
  [2,1,3],
  [1,null,2,null,3]
]
Explanation:
The above output corresponds to the 5 unique BST's shown below:

   1         3     3      2      1
    \       /     /      / \      \
     3     2     1      1   3      2
    /     /       \                 \
   2     1         2                 3
```

Constraints:

- 0 <= n <= 8

Solution:
```cpp
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x, TreeNode *left, TreeNode *right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {

    vector<TreeNode*> generateTrees(int n) {
        
    }
};
```

## 357. Count Numbers with Unique Digits

Given a non-negative integer n, count all numbers with unique digits, x, where 0 ≤ x < 10n.

Example:
```
Input: 2
Output: 91 
Explanation: The answer should be the total numbers in the range of 0 ≤ x < 100, 
             excluding 11,22,33,44,55,66,77,88,99
```

Constraints:

- 0 <= n <= 8

Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int countNumbersWithUniqueDigits(int n) {
        
    }
};
```

## 123. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock III

Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.

Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete at most two transactions.

Note: You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).

Example 1:
```
Input: [3,3,5,0,0,3,1,4]
Output: 6
Explanation: Buy on day 4 (price = 0) and sell on day 6 (price = 3), 
             profit = 3-0 = 3. Then buy on day 7 (price = 1) and sell
             on day 8 (price = 4), profit = 4-1 = 3.
```
Example 2:
```            
Input: [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 4
Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 5), 
             profit = 5-1 = 4. Note that you cannot buy on day 1, 
             buy on day 2 and sell them later, as you are
             engaging multiple transactions at the same time. 
             You must sell before buying again.
```
Example 3:
```        
Input: [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.
```

Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxProfit(vector<int>& prices) {
        
    }
};
```

## 62. Unique Paths

A robot is located at the top-left corner of a m x n grid (marked 'Start' in the diagram below).

The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time. The robot is trying to reach the bottom-right corner of the grid (marked 'Finish' in the diagram below).

How many possible unique paths are there?

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/10/22/robot_maze.png)

Above is a 7 x 3 grid. How many possible unique paths are there?

Example 1:
```
Input: m = 3, n = 2
Output: 3
Explanation:
From the top-left corner, there are a total of 3 ways to reach the bottom-right corner:
1. Right -> Right -> Down
2. Right -> Down -> Right
3. Down -> Right -> Right
```

Example 2:
```
Input: m = 7, n = 3
Output: 28
```

Constraints:

- 1 <= m, n <= 100
- It's guaranteed that the answer will be less than or equal to 2 * 10 ^ 9.

Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int uniquePaths(int m, int n) {
        
    }
};
```

## 303. Range Sum Query - Immutable

Given an integer array nums, find the sum of the elements between indices i and j (i ≤ j), inclusive.

Example:
```
Given nums = [-2, 0, 3, -5, 2, -1]

sumRange(0, 2) -> 1
sumRange(2, 5) -> -1
sumRange(0, 5) -> -3
```
Note:
- You may assume that the array does not change.
- There are many calls to sumRange function.

Solution:
```cpp
class NumArray {
public:
    NumArray(vector<int>& nums) {
        
    }
    
    int sumRange(int i, int j) {
        
    }
};

/**
 * Your NumArray object will be instantiated and called as such:
 * NumArray* obj = new NumArray(nums);
 * int param_1 = obj->sumRange(i,j);
 */
```

## 413. Arithmetic Slices

A sequence of numbers is called arithmetic if it consists of at least three elements and if the difference between any two consecutive elements is the same.

For example, these are arithmetic sequences:
```
1, 3, 5, 7, 9
7, 7, 7, 7
3, -1, -5, -9
```
The following sequence is not arithmetic.
```
1, 1, 2, 5, 7
```
A zero-indexed array A consisting of N numbers is given. A slice of that array is any pair of integers (P, Q) such that 0 <= P < Q < N.

A slice (P, Q) of the array A is called arithmetic if the sequence:
A[P], A[P + 1], ..., A[Q - 1], A[Q] is arithmetic. In particular, this means that P + 1 < Q.

The function should return the number of arithmetic slices in the array A.

 
Example:
```
A = [1, 2, 3, 4]

return: 3, for 3 arithmetic slices in A: [1, 2, 3], [2, 3, 4] 
and [1, 2, 3, 4] itself.
```

Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int numberOfArithmeticSlices(vector<int>& A) {
        
    }
};
```

## 647. Palindromic Substrings

Given a string, your task is to count how many palindromic substrings in this string.

The substrings with different start indexes or end indexes are counted as different substrings even they consist of same characters.

Example 1:
```
Input: "abc"
Output: 3
Explanation: Three palindromic strings: "a", "b", "c".
```

Example 2:
```
Input: "aaa"
Output: 6
Explanation: Six palindromic strings: "a", "a", "a", "aa", "aa", "aaa".
```

Note:

- The input string length won't exceed 1000.

Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int countSubstrings(string s) {
        
    }
};
```

## 140. Word Break II

Given a non-empty string s and a dictionary wordDict containing a list of non-empty words, add spaces in s to construct a sentence where each word is a valid dictionary word. Return all such possible sentences.

Note:

- The same word in the dictionary may be reused multiple times in the segmentation.
- You may assume the dictionary does not contain duplicate words.

Example 1:
```
Input:
s = "catsanddog"
wordDict = ["cat", "cats", "and", "sand", "dog"]
Output:
[
  "cats and dog",
  "cat sand dog"
]

1 0 1 0 0
1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 1 0

Output: 4
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maximalSquare(vector<vector<char>>& matrix) {
        
    }
};
```

## 91. Decode Ways

A message containing letters from A-Z is being encoded to numbers using the following mapping:
```
'A' -> 1
'B' -> 2
...
'Z' -> 26
```
Given a non-empty string containing only digits, determine the total number of ways to decode it.

Example 1:
```
Input: "12"
Output: 2
Explanation: It could be decoded as "AB" (1 2) or "L" (12).
```
Example 2:
```
Input: "226"
Output: 3
Explanation: It could be decoded as "BZ" (2 26), "VF" (22 6), or "BBF" (2 2 6).
```

Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int numDecodings(string s) {
        
    }
};
```

## 97. Interleaving String

Given s1, s2, s3, find whether s3 is formed by the interleaving of s1 and s2.

Example 1:
```
Input: s1 = "aabcc", s2 = "dbbca", s3 = "aadbbcbcac"
Output: true
```
Example 2:
```
Input: s1 = "aabcc", s2 = "dbbca", s3 = "aadbbbaccc"
Output: false
```

Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool isInterleave(string s1, string s2, string s3) {
        
    }
};
```

## 115. Distinct Subsequences

Given a string S and a string T, count the number of distinct subsequences of S which equals T.

A subsequence of a string is a new string which is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (ie, "ACE" is a subsequence of "ABCDE" while "AEC" is not).

It's guaranteed the answer fits on a 32-bit signed integer.

Example 1:
```
Input: S = "rabbbit", T = "rabbit"
Output: 3
Explanation:
As shown below, there are 3 ways you can generate "rabbit" from S.
(The caret symbol ^ means the chosen letters)

rabbbit
^^^^ ^^
rabbbit
^^ ^^^^
rabbbit
^^^ ^^^
```
Example 2:
```
Input: S = "babgbag", T = "bag"
Output: 5
Explanation:
As shown below, there are 5 ways you can generate "bag" from S.
(The caret symbol ^ means the chosen letters)

babgbag
^^ ^
babgbag
^^    ^
babgbag
^    ^^
babgbag
  ^  ^^
babgbag
    ^^^
```

Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int numDistinct(string s, string t) {
        
    }
};
```

## 1140. Stone Game II

Alex and Lee continue their games with piles of stones.  There are a number of piles arranged in a row, and each pile has a positive integer number of stones piles[i].  The objective of the game is to end with the most stones. 

Alex and Lee take turns, with Alex starting first.  Initially, M = 1.

On each player's turn, that player can take all the stones in the first X remaining piles, where 1 <= X <= 2M.  Then, we set M = max(M, X).

The game continues until all the stones have been taken.

Assuming Alex and Lee play optimally, return the maximum number of stones Alex can get.

 

Example 1:
```
Input: piles = [2,7,9,4,4]
Output: 10
Explanation:  If Alex takes one pile at the beginning, 
Lee takes two piles, then Alex takes 2 piles again. Alex 
can get 2 + 4 + 4 = 10 piles in total. If Alex takes two 
piles at the beginning, then Lee can take all three piles 
left. In this case, Alex get 2 + 7 = 9 piles in total. So 
we return 10 since it's larger. 
``` 

Constraints:

- 1 <= piles.length <= 100
- 1 <= piles[i] <= 10 ^ 4

Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int stoneGameII(vector<int>& piles) {
        
    }
};
```

## 322. Coin Change

You are given coins of different denominations and a total amount of money amount. Write a function to compute the fewest number of coins that you need to make up that amount. If that amount of money cannot be made up by any combination of the coins, return -1.

Example 1:

```
Input: coins = [1, 2, 5], amount = 11
Output: 3 
Explanation: 11 = 5 + 5 + 1
```
Example 2:
```
Input: coins = [2], amount = 3
Output: -1
```
Note:
You may assume that you have an infinite number of each kind of coin.

Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int coinChange(vector<int>& coins, int amount) {
        
    }
};
```

## 410. Split Array Largest Sum
 
Given an array which consists of non-negative integers and an integer m, you can split the array into m non-empty continuous subarrays. Write an algorithm to minimize the largest sum among these m subarrays.

Note:
If n is the length of array, assume the following constraints are satisfied:

- 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000
- 1 ≤ m ≤ min(50, n)

Examples:
```            
Input:
nums = [7,2,5,10,8]
m = 2

Output:
18

Explanation:
There are four ways to split nums into two subarrays.
The best way is to split it into [7,2,5] and [10,8],
where the largest sum among the two subarrays is only 18.
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int splitArray(vector<int>& nums, int m) {
        
    }
};
```

## 375. Guess Number Higher or Lower II

We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows:

I pick a number from 1 to n. You have to guess which number I picked.

Every time you guess wrong, I'll tell you whether the number I picked is higher or lower.

However, when you guess a particular number x, and you guess wrong, you pay $x. You win the game when you guess the number I picked.

Example:
```
n = 10, I pick 8.

First round:  You guess 5, I tell you that it's higher. You pay $5.
Second round: You guess 7, I tell you that it's higher. You pay $7.
Third round:  You guess 9, I tell you that it's lower. You pay $9.

Game over. 8 is the number I picked.

You end up paying $5 + $7 + $9 = $21.
```

Given a particular n ≥ 1, find out how much money you need to have to guarantee a win.

Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int getMoneyAmount(int n) {
        
    }
};
```

## 188. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock IV

Say you have an array for which the i-th element is the price of a given stock on day i.

Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete at most k transactions.

Note:
You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (ie, you must sell the stock before you buy again).

Example 1:
```
Input: [2,4,1], k = 2
Output: 2
Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 2) and sell on day 2 (price = 4), 
profit = 4-2 = 2.
```
Example 2:
```
Input: [3,2,6,5,0,3], k = 2
Output: 7
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 2) and sell on day 3 (price = 6), 
             profit = 6-2 = 4. Then buy on day 5 (price = 0) and sell 
             on day 6 (price = 3), profit = 3-0 = 3.
```

Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxProfit(int k, vector<int>& prices) {
        
    }
};
```
