## 5. Longest Palindromic Substring

Given a string s, find the longest palindromic substring in s. You may assume that the maximum length of s is 1000.

Example 1:
```
Input: "babad"
Output: "bab"
Note: "aba" is also a valid answer.
```

Example 2:
```
Input: "cbbd"
Output: "bb"
```

Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    string longestPalindrome(string s) {
        
    }
};
```

## 53. Maximum Subarray

Given an integer array nums, find the contiguous subarray (containing at least one number) which has the largest sum and return its sum.

Example:
```
Input: [-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4],
Output: 6
Explanation: [4,-1,2,1] has the largest sum = 6.
```
Follow up:

If you have figured out the O(n) solution, try coding another solution using the divide and conquer approach, which is more subtle.

Solution:

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxSubArray(vector<int>& nums) {
        
    }
};
```

## 121. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock

Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.

If you were only permitted to complete at most one transaction (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock), design an algorithm to find the maximum profit.

Note that you cannot sell a stock before you buy one.

Example 1:
```
Input: [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
             Not 7-1 = 6, as selling price needs to be larger than buying price.
```

Example 2:
```
Input: [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.
```

Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxProfit(vector<int>& prices) {
        
    }
};
```

## 85. Maximal Rectangle

Given a 2D binary matrix filled with 0's and 1's, find the largest rectangle containing only 1's and return its area.

Example:
```
Input:
[
  ["1","0","1","0","0"],
  ["1","0","1","1","1"],
  ["1","1","1","1","1"],
  ["1","0","0","1","0"]
]
Output: 6
```

Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maximalRectangle(vector<vector<char>>& matrix) {
        
    }
};
```

## 10. Regular Expression Matching

Given an input string (s) and a pattern (p), implement regular expression matching with support for '.' and '*'.
```
'.' Matches any single character.
'*' Matches zero or more of the preceding element.
```
The matching should cover the entire input string (not partial).

Note:

- s could be empty and contains only lowercase letters a-z.
- p could be empty and contains only lowercase letters a-z, and characters like . or *.

Example 1:
```
Input:
s = "aa"
p = "a"
Output: false
Explanation: "a" does not match the entire string "aa".
```
Example 2:
```
Input:
s = "aa"
p = "a*"
Output: true
Explanation: '*' means zero or more of the preceding element, 'a'. 
Therefore, by repeating 'a' once, it becomes "aa".
```
Example 3:
```
Input:
s = "ab"
p = ".*"
Output: true
Explanation: ".*" means "zero or more (*) of any character (.)".
```
Example 4:
```
Input:
s = "aab"
p = "c*a*b"
Output: true
Explanation: c can be repeated 0 times, a can be repeated 1 time. 
Therefore, it matches "aab".
```

Example 5:
```
Input:
s = "mississippi"
p = "mis*is*p*."
Output: false
```

Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool isMatch(string s, string p) {
        
    }
};
```

## 312. Burst Balloons

Given n balloons, indexed from 0 to n-1. Each balloon is painted with a number on it represented by array nums. You are asked to burst all the balloons. If the you burst balloon i you will get nums[left] * nums[i] * nums[right] coins. Here left and right are adjacent indices of i. After the burst, the left and right then becomes adjacent.

Find the maximum coins you can collect by bursting the balloons wisely.

Note:

- You may imagine nums[-1] = nums[n] = 1. They are not real therefore you can not burst them.
- 0 ≤ n ≤ 500, 0 ≤ nums[i] ≤ 100

Example:

```
Input: [3,1,5,8]
Output: 167 
Explanation: nums = [3,1,5,8] --> [3,5,8] -->   [3,8]   -->  [8]  --> []
             coins =  3*1*5      +  3*5*8    +  1*3*8      + 1*8*1   = 167
```

Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxCoins(vector<int>& nums) {
        
    }
};
```

## 96. Unique Binary Search Trees

Given n, how many structurally unique BST's (binary search trees) that store values 1 ... n?

Example:
```
Input: 3
Output: 5
Explanation:
Given n = 3, there are a total of 5 unique BST's:

   1         3     3      2      1
    \       /     /      / \      \
     3     2     1      1   3      2
    /     /       \                 \
   2     1         2                 3
```

Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int numTrees(int n) {
        
    }
};
```

## 70. Climbing Stairs

You are climbing a stair case. It takes n steps to reach to the top.

Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?

Example 1:
```
Input: 2
Output: 2
Explanation: There are two ways to climb to the top.
1. 1 step + 1 step
2. 2 steps
```
Example 2:
```
Input: 3
Output: 3
Explanation: There are three ways to climb to the top.
1. 1 step + 1 step + 1 step
2. 1 step + 2 steps
3. 2 steps + 1 step
```

Constraints:

- 1 <= n <= 45

Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int climbStairs(int n) {
        
    }
};
```

## 198. House Robber

You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed, the only constraint stopping you from robbing each of them is that adjacent houses have security system connected and it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night.

Given a list of non-negative integers representing the amount of money of each house, determine the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight without alerting the police.

 

Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
Output: 4
Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 1) and then rob house 3 (money = 3).
             Total amount you can rob = 1 + 3 = 4.
```
Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [2,7,9,3,1]
Output: 12
Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 2), rob house 3 (money = 9) and rob house 5 (money = 1).
             Total amount you can rob = 2 + 9 + 1 = 12.
```

Constraints:

- 0 <= nums.length <= 100
- 0 <= nums[i] <= 400

Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int rob(vector<int>& nums) {
        
    }
};
```

## 139. Word Break

Given a non-empty string s and a dictionary wordDict containing a list of non-empty words, determine if s can be segmented into a space-separated sequence of one or more dictionary words.

Note:

The same word in the dictionary may be reused multiple times in the segmentation.
You may assume the dictionary does not contain duplicate words.

Example 1:
```
Input: s = "leetcode", wordDict = ["leet", "code"]
Output: true
Explanation: Return true because "leetcode" can be segmented as "leet code".
```
Example 2:
```
Input: s = "applepenapple", wordDict = ["apple", "pen"]
Output: true
Explanation: Return true because "applepenapple" can be segmented as "apple pen apple".
             Note that you are allowed to reuse a dictionary word.
```             
Example 3:
```
Input: s = "catsandog", wordDict = ["cats", "dog", "sand", "and", "cat"]
Output: false
```

Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool wordBreak(string s, vector<string>& wordDict) {
        
    }
};
```

## 72. Edit Distance

Given two words word1 and word2, find the minimum number of operations required to convert word1 to word2.

You have the following 3 operations permitted on a word:

Insert a character
Delete a character
Replace a character

Example 1:
```
Input: word1 = "horse", word2 = "ros"
Output: 3
Explanation: 
horse -> rorse (replace 'h' with 'r')
rorse -> rose (remove 'r')
rose -> ros (remove 'e')
```
Example 2:
```
Input: word1 = "intention", word2 = "execution"
Output: 5
Explanation: 
intention -> inention (remove 't')
inention -> enention (replace 'i' with 'e')
enention -> exention (replace 'n' with 'x')
exention -> exection (replace 'n' with 'c')
exection -> execution (insert 'u')
```
Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minDistance(string word1, string word2) {
        
    }
};
```

## 152. Maximum Product Subarray

Given an integer array nums, find the contiguous subarray within an array (containing at least one number) which has the largest product.

Example 1:
```
Input: [2,3,-2,4]
Output: 6
Explanation: [2,3] has the largest product 6.
```
Example 2:
```
Input: [-2,0,-1]
Output: 0
Explanation: The result cannot be 2, because [-2,-1] is not a subarray.
```

Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxProduct(vector<int>& nums) {
        
    }
};
```

## 1130. Minimum Cost Tree From Leaf Values

Given an array arr of positive integers, consider all binary trees such that:

- Each node has either 0 or 2 children;
- The values of arr correspond to the values of each leaf in an in-order traversal of the tree.  (Recall that a node is a leaf if and only if it has 0 children.)
- The value of each non-leaf node is equal to the product of the largest leaf value in its left and right subtree respectively.

Among all possible binary trees considered, return the smallest possible sum of the values of each non-leaf node.  It is guaranteed this sum fits into a 32-bit integer. 

Example 1:
```
Input: arr = [6,2,4]
Output: 32
Explanation:
There are two possible trees.  The first has non-leaf node sum 36, and the 
second has non-leaf node sum 32.

    24            24
   /  \          /  \
  12   4        6    8
 /  \               / \
6    2             2   4
```

Constraints:

- 2 <= arr.length <= 40
- 1 <= arr[i] <= 15
- It is guaranteed that the answer fits into a 32-bit signed integer (ie. it is less than 2^31).

Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int mctFromLeafValues(vector<int>& arr) {
        
    }
};
```

## 338. Counting Bits

Given a non negative integer number num. For every numbers i in the range 0 ≤ i ≤ num calculate the number of 1's in their binary representation and return them as an array.

Example 1:
```
Input: 2
Output: [0,1,1]
```
Example 2:
```
Input: 5
Output: [0,1,1,2,1,2]
```
Follow up:

- It is very easy to come up with a solution with run time O(n*sizeof(integer)). But can you do it in linear time O(n) /possibly in a single pass?
- Space complexity should be O(n).
- Can you do it like a boss? Do it without using any builtin function like __builtin_popcount in c++ or in any other language.

Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> countBits(int num) {
        
    }
};
```

## 279. Perfect Squares

Given a positive integer n, find the least number of perfect square numbers (for example, 1, 4, 9, 16, ...) which sum to n.

Example 1:
```
Input: n = 12
Output: 3 
Explanation: 12 = 4 + 4 + 4.
```
Example 2:
```
Input: n = 13
Output: 2
Explanation: 13 = 4 + 9.
```

Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int numSquares(int n) {
        
    }
};
```

## 120. Triangle

Given a triangle, find the minimum path sum from top to bottom. Each step you may move to adjacent numbers on the row below.

For example, given the following triangle
```
[
     [2],
    [3,4],
   [6,5,7],
  [4,1,8,3]
]
```
The minimum path sum from top to bottom is 11 (i.e., 2 + 3 + 5 + 1 = 11).

Note:

Bonus point if you are able to do this using only O(n) extra space, where n is the total number of rows in the triangle.

Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minimumTotal(vector<vector<int>>& triangle) {
        
    }
};
```

## 64. Minimum Path Sum

Given a m x n grid filled with non-negative numbers, find a path from top left to bottom right which minimizes the sum of all numbers along its path.

Note: You can only move either down or right at any point in time.

Example:
```
Input:
[
  [1,3,1],
  [1,5,1],
  [4,2,1]
]
Output: 7
Explanation: Because the path 1→3→1→1→1 minimizes the sum.
```

Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minPathSum(vector<vector<int>>& grid) {
        
    }
};
```

## 309. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock with Cooldown

Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.

Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete as many transactions as you like (ie, buy one and sell one share of the stock multiple times) with the following restrictions:

- You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (ie, you must sell the stock before you buy again).
- After you sell your stock, you cannot buy stock on next day. (ie, cooldown 1 day)

Example:
```
Input: [1,2,3,0,2]
Output: 3 
Explanation: transactions = [buy, sell, cooldown, buy, sell]
```

Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxProfit(vector<int>& prices) {
        
    }
};
```

## 1025. Divisor Game

Alice and Bob take turns playing a game, with Alice starting first.

Initially, there is a number N on the chalkboard.  On each player's turn, that player makes a move consisting of:

Choosing any x with 0 < x < N and N % x == 0.
Replacing the number N on the chalkboard with N - x.
Also, if a player cannot make a move, they lose the game.

Return True if and only if Alice wins the game, assuming both players play optimally.

Example 1:
```
Input: 2
Output: true
Explanation: Alice chooses 1, and Bob has no more moves.
```
Example 2:
```
Input: 3
Output: false
Explanation: Alice chooses 1, Bob chooses 1, and Alice has no more moves.
```

Note:

- 1 <= N <= 1000

Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool divisorGame(int N) {
        
    }
};
```

## 32. Longest Valid Parentheses

Given a string containing just the characters '(' and ')', find the length of the longest valid (well-formed) parentheses substring.

Example 1:
```
Input: "(()"
Output: 2
Explanation: The longest valid parentheses substring is "()"
```
Example 2:
```
Input: ")()())"
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest valid parentheses substring is "()()"
```

Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int longestValidParentheses(string s) {
        
    }
};
```

## 95. Unique Binary Search Trees II

Given an integer n, generate all structurally unique BST's (binary search trees) that store values 1 ... n.

Example:
```
Input: 3
Output:
[
  [1,null,3,2],
  [3,2,null,1],
  [3,1,null,null,2],
  [2,1,3],
  [1,null,2,null,3]
]
Explanation:
The above output corresponds to the 5 unique BST's shown below:

   1         3     3      2      1
    \       /     /      / \      \
     3     2     1      1   3      2
    /     /       \                 \
   2     1         2                 3
```

Constraints:

- 0 <= n <= 8

Solution:
```cpp
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x, TreeNode *left, TreeNode *right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    vector<TreeNode*> generateTrees(int n) {
        
    }
};
```

## 357. Count Numbers with Unique Digits

Given a non-negative integer n, count all numbers with unique digits, x, where 0 ≤ x < 10n.

Example:
```
Input: 2
Output: 91 
Explanation: The answer should be the total numbers in the range of 0 ≤ x < 100, 
             excluding 11,22,33,44,55,66,77,88,99
```

Constraints:

- 0 <= n <= 8

Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int countNumbersWithUniqueDigits(int n) {
        
    }
};
```

## 123. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock III

Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.

Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete at most two transactions.

Note: You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).

Example 1:
```
Input: [3,3,5,0,0,3,1,4]
Output: 6
Explanation: Buy on day 4 (price = 0) and sell on day 6 (price = 3), 
             profit = 3-0 = 3. Then buy on day 7 (price = 1) and sell
             on day 8 (price = 4), profit = 4-1 = 3.
```
Example 2:
```            
Input: [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 4
Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 5), 
             profit = 5-1 = 4. Note that you cannot buy on day 1, 
             buy on day 2 and sell them later, as you are
             engaging multiple transactions at the same time. 
             You must sell before buying again.
```
Example 3:
```        
Input: [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.
```

Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxProfit(vector<int>& prices) {
        
    }
};
```
