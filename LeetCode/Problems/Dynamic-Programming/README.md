## 5. Longest Palindromic Substring

Given a string s, find the longest palindromic substring in s. You may assume that the maximum length of s is 1000.

Example 1:
```
Input: "babad"
Output: "bab"
Note: "aba" is also a valid answer.
```

Example 2:
```
Input: "cbbd"
Output: "bb"
```

Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    string longestPalindrome(string s) {
        
    }
};
```

## 53. Maximum Subarray

Given an integer array nums, find the contiguous subarray (containing at least one number) which has the largest sum and return its sum.

Example:
```
Input: [-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4],
Output: 6
Explanation: [4,-1,2,1] has the largest sum = 6.
```
Follow up:

If you have figured out the O(n) solution, try coding another solution using the divide and conquer approach, which is more subtle.

Solution:

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxSubArray(vector<int>& nums) {
        
    }
};
```

## 121. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock

Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.

If you were only permitted to complete at most one transaction (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock), design an algorithm to find the maximum profit.

Note that you cannot sell a stock before you buy one.

Example 1:
```
Input: [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
             Not 7-1 = 6, as selling price needs to be larger than buying price.
```

Example 2:
```
Input: [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.
```

Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxProfit(vector<int>& prices) {
        
    }
};
```

## 85. Maximal Rectangle

Given a 2D binary matrix filled with 0's and 1's, find the largest rectangle containing only 1's and return its area.

Example:
```
Input:
[
  ["1","0","1","0","0"],
  ["1","0","1","1","1"],
  ["1","1","1","1","1"],
  ["1","0","0","1","0"]
]
Output: 6
```

Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maximalRectangle(vector<vector<char>>& matrix) {
        
    }
};
```

## 10. Regular Expression Matching

Given an input string (s) and a pattern (p), implement regular expression matching with support for '.' and '*'.
```
'.' Matches any single character.
'*' Matches zero or more of the preceding element.
```
The matching should cover the entire input string (not partial).

Note:

- s could be empty and contains only lowercase letters a-z.
- p could be empty and contains only lowercase letters a-z, and characters like . or *.

Example 1:
```
Input:
s = "aa"
p = "a"
Output: false
Explanation: "a" does not match the entire string "aa".
```
Example 2:
```
Input:
s = "aa"
p = "a*"
Output: true
Explanation: '*' means zero or more of the preceding element, 'a'. 
Therefore, by repeating 'a' once, it becomes "aa".
```
Example 3:
```
Input:
s = "ab"
p = ".*"
Output: true
Explanation: ".*" means "zero or more (*) of any character (.)".
```
Example 4:
```
Input:
s = "aab"
p = "c*a*b"
Output: true
Explanation: c can be repeated 0 times, a can be repeated 1 time. 
Therefore, it matches "aab".
```

Example 5:
```
Input:
s = "mississippi"
p = "mis*is*p*."
Output: false
```

Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool isMatch(string s, string p) {
        
    }
};
```
