# Array

Sorted by frequency, only includes green and yellow.

## 1. Two Sum

Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

Example:

Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,

Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,
return [0, 1].

Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> twoSum(vector<int>& nums, int target) {
        
    }
};
```

## 4. Median of Two Sorted Arrays

There are two sorted arrays nums1 and nums2 of size m and n respectively.

Find the median of the two sorted arrays. The overall run time complexity should be O(log (m+n)).

You may assume nums1 and nums2 cannot be both empty.

Example 1:
```
nums1 = [1, 3]
nums2 = [2]

The median is 2.0
```
Example 2:
```
nums1 = [1, 2]
nums2 = [3, 4]

The median is (2 + 3)/2 = 2.5
```

Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    double findMedianSortedArrays(vector<int>& nums1, vector<int>& nums2) {
        
    }
};
```

## 11. Container With Most Water

Given n non-negative integers a1, a2, ..., an , where each represents a point at coordinate (i, ai). n vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of line i is at (i, ai) and (i, 0). Find two lines, which together with x-axis forms a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Note: You may not slant the container and n is at least 2.

![](https://s3-lc-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2018/07/17/question_11.jpg)

The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49.

Example:
```
Input: [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
Output: 49
```

Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxArea(vector<int>& height) {
        
    }
};
```

## 42. Trapping Rain Water

Given n non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is 1, compute how much water it is able to trap after raining.

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/10/22/rainwatertrap.png)

The above elevation map is represented by array [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]. In this case, 6 units of rain water (blue section) are being trapped. Thanks Marcos for contributing this image!

Example:
```
Input: [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]
Output: 6
```

Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int trap(vector<int>& height) {
        
    }
};
```

## 53. Maximum Subarray

Given an integer array nums, find the contiguous subarray (containing at least one number) which has the largest sum and return its sum.

Example:
```
Input: [-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4],
Output: 6
Explanation: [4,-1,2,1] has the largest sum = 6.
```

Follow up:

If you have figured out the O(n) solution, try coding another solution using the divide and conquer approach, which is more subtle.

Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxSubArray(vector<int>& nums) {
        
    }
};
```

## 15. 3Sum

Given an array nums of n integers, are there elements a, b, c in nums such that a + b + c = 0? Find all unique triplets in the array which gives the sum of zero.

Note:

The solution set must not contain duplicate triplets.

Example:
```
Given array nums = [-1, 0, 1, 2, -1, -4],

A solution set is:
[
  [-1, 0, 1],
  [-1, -1, 2]
]
```

Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<int>> threeSum(vector<int>& nums) {
        
    }
};
```

## 121. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock

Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.

If you were only permitted to complete at most one transaction (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock), design an algorithm to find the maximum profit.

Note that you cannot sell a stock before you buy one.

Example 1:
```
Input: [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
             Not 7-1 = 6, as selling price needs to be larger than buying price.
```

Example 2:
```
Input: [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.
```

Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxProfit(vector<int>& prices) {
        
    }
};
```

## 238. Product of Array Except Self

Given an array nums of n integers where n > 1,  return an array output such that output[i] is equal to the product of all the elements of nums except nums[i].

Example:
```
Input:  [1,2,3,4]
Output: [24,12,8,6]
```

Constraint: It's guaranteed that the product of the elements of any prefix or suffix of the array (including the whole array) fits in a 32 bit integer.

Note: Please solve it without division and in O(n).

Follow up:
Could you solve it with constant space complexity? (The output array does not count as extra space for the purpose of space complexity analysis.)

Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> productExceptSelf(vector<int>& nums) {
        
    }
};
```

## 561. Array Partition I

Given an array of 2n integers, your task is to group these integers into n pairs of integer, say (a1, b1), (a2, b2), ..., (an, bn) which makes sum of min(ai, bi) for all i from 1 to n as large as possible.

Example 1:
```
Input: [1,4,3,2]

Output: 4
Explanation: n is 2, and the maximum sum of pairs is 4 = min(1, 2) + min(3, 4).
```
Note:
- n is a positive integer, which is in the range of [1, 10000].
- All the integers in the array will be in the range of [-10000, 10000].

Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int arrayPairSum(vector<int>& nums) {
        
    }
};
```


## 85. Maximal Rectangle

Given a 2D binary matrix filled with 0's and 1's, find the largest rectangle containing only 1's and return its area.

Example:
```
Input:
[
  ["1","0","1","0","0"],
  ["1","0","1","1","1"],
  ["1","1","1","1","1"],
  ["1","0","0","1","0"]
]
Output: 6
```

Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maximalRectangle(vector<vector<char>>& matrix) {
        
    }
};
```

## 169. Majority Element

Given an array of size n, find the majority element. The majority element is the element that appears more than ⌊ n/2 ⌋ times.

You may assume that the array is non-empty and the majority element always exist in the array.

Example 1:
```
Input: [3,2,3]
Output: 3
```
Example 2:
```
Input: [2,2,1,1,1,2,2]
Output: 2
```

Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int majorityElement(vector<int>& nums) {
        
    }
};
```

## 66. Plus One

Given a non-empty array of digits representing a non-negative integer, increment one to the integer.

The digits are stored such that the most significant digit is at the head of the list, and each element in the array contains a single digit.

You may assume the integer does not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.

Example 1:
```
Input: [1,2,3]
Output: [1,2,4]
Explanation: The array represents the integer 123.
```
Example 2:
```
Input: [4,3,2,1]
Output: [4,3,2,2]
Explanation: The array represents the integer 4321.
```

Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> plusOne(vector<int>& digits) {
        
    }
};
```

## 56. Merge Intervals

Given a collection of intervals, merge all overlapping intervals.

Example 1:
```
Input: [[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
Output: [[1,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
Explanation: Since intervals [1,3] and [2,6] overlaps, merge them into [1,6].
```
Example 2:
```
Input: [[1,4],[4,5]]
Output: [[1,5]]
Explanation: Intervals [1,4] and [4,5] are considered overlapping.
```
NOTE: input types have been changed on April 15, 2019. Please reset to default code definition to get new method signature.

Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<int>> merge(vector<vector<int>>& intervals) {
        
    }
};
```

## 88. Merge Sorted Array

Given two sorted integer arrays nums1 and nums2, merge nums2 into nums1 as one sorted array.

Note:

- The number of elements initialized in nums1 and nums2 are m and n respectively.
- You may assume that nums1 has enough space (size that is equal to m + n) to hold additional elements from nums2.

Example:
```
Input:
nums1 = [1,2,3,0,0,0], m = 3
nums2 = [2,5,6],       n = 3

Output: [1,2,2,3,5,6]
```

Constraints:

- -10^9 <= nums1[i], nums2[i] <= 10^9
- nums1.length == m + n
- nums2.length == n

Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    void merge(vector<int>& nums1, int m, vector<int>& nums2, int n) {
        
    }
};
```

## 16. 3Sum Closest

Given an array nums of n integers and an integer target, find three integers in nums such that the sum is closest to target. Return the sum of the three integers. You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution.


Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [-1,2,1,-4], target = 1
Output: 2
Explanation: The sum that is closest to the target is 2. (-1 + 2 + 1 = 2).
```

Constraints:

- 3 <= nums.length <= 10^3
- -10^3 <= nums[i] <= 10^3
- -10^4 <= target <= 10^4

Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int threeSumClosest(vector<int>& nums, int target) {
        
    }
};
```


## 283. Move Zeroes

Given an array nums, write a function to move all 0's to the end of it while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements.

Example:
```
Input: [0,1,0,3,12]
Output: [1,3,12,0,0]
```
Note:

- You must do this in-place without making a copy of the array.
- Minimize the total number of operations.

Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    void moveZeroes(vector<int>& nums) {
        
    }
};
```

## 122. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock II

Say you have an array prices for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.

Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete as many transactions as you like (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock multiple times).

Note: You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).

Example 1:
```        
Input: [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 7
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 3 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
             Then buy on day 4 (price = 3) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-3 = 3.
```
Example 2:
```
Input: [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 4
Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
             Note that you cannot buy on day 1, buy on day 2 and sell them later, as you are
             engaging multiple transactions at the same time. You must sell before buying again.
```
Example 3:
```
Input: [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.
```


Constraints:

- 1 <= prices.length <= 3 * 10 ^ 4
- 0 <= prices[i] <= 10 ^ 4

Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxProfit(vector<int>& prices) {
        
    }
};
```

## 31. Next Permutation

Implement next permutation, which rearranges numbers into the lexicographically next greater permutation of numbers.

If such arrangement is not possible, it must rearrange it as the lowest possible order (ie, sorted in ascending order).

The replacement must be in-place and use only constant extra memory.

Here are some examples. Inputs are in the left-hand column and its corresponding outputs are in the right-hand column.

```
1,2,3 → 1,3,2
3,2,1 → 1,2,3
1,1,5 → 1,5,1
```

Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    void nextPermutation(vector<int>& nums) {
        
    }
};
```

## 48. Rotate Image

You are given an n x n 2D matrix representing an image.

Rotate the image by 90 degrees (clockwise).

Note:

You have to rotate the image in-place, which means you have to modify the input 2D matrix directly. DO NOT allocate another 2D matrix and do the rotation.

Example 1:
```
Given input matrix = 
[
  [1,2,3],
  [4,5,6],
  [7,8,9]
],

rotate the input matrix in-place such that it becomes:
[
  [7,4,1],
  [8,5,2],
  [9,6,3]
]
```
Example 2:
```
Given input matrix =
[
  [ 5, 1, 9,11],
  [ 2, 4, 8,10],
  [13, 3, 6, 7],
  [15,14,12,16]
], 

rotate the input matrix in-place such that it becomes:
[
  [15,13, 2, 5],
  [14, 3, 4, 1],
  [12, 6, 8, 9],
  [16, 7,10,11]
]
```

Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    void rotate(vector<vector<int>>& matrix) {
        
    }
};
```

## 289. Game of Life

According to the Wikipedia's article: "The Game of Life, also known simply as Life, is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970."

Given a board with m by n cells, each cell has an initial state live (1) or dead (0). Each cell interacts with its eight neighbors (horizontal, vertical, diagonal) using the following four rules (taken from the above Wikipedia article):

- Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if caused by under-population.
- Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.
- Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by over-population..
- Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

Write a function to compute the next state (after one update) of the board given its current state. The next state is created by applying the above rules simultaneously to every cell in the current state, where births and deaths occur simultaneously.

Example:
```
Input: 
[
  [0,1,0],
  [0,0,1],
  [1,1,1],
  [0,0,0]
]
Output: 
[
  [0,0,0],
  [1,0,1],
  [0,1,1],
  [0,1,0]
]
```
Follow up:

- Could you solve it in-place? Remember that the board needs to be updated at the same time: You cannot update some cells first and then use their updated values to update other cells.
- In this question, we represent the board using a 2D array. In principle, the board is infinite, which would cause problems when the active area encroaches the border of the array. How would you address these problems?

Solution:

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    void gameOfLife(vector<vector<int>>& board) {
        
    }
};
```

## 128. Longest Consecutive Sequence

Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.

Your algorithm should run in O(n) complexity.

Example:
```
Input: [100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2]
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest consecutive elements sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4]. Therefore its length is 4.
```

Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int longestConsecutive(vector<int>& nums) {
        
    }
};
```

## 41. First Missing Positive

Given an unsorted integer array, find the smallest missing positive integer.

Example 1:
```
Input: [1,2,0]
Output: 3
```
Example 2:
```
Input: [3,4,-1,1]
Output: 2
```
Example 3:
```
Input: [7,8,9,11,12]
Output: 1
```
Note:

Your algorithm should run in O(n) time and uses constant extra space.

Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int firstMissingPositive(vector<int>& nums) {
        
    }
};
```

## 152. Maximum Product Subarray

Given an integer array nums, find the contiguous subarray within an array (containing at least one number) which has the largest product.

Example 1:
```
Input: [2,3,-2,4]
Output: 6
Explanation: [2,3] has the largest product 6.
```
Example 2:
```
Input: [-2,0,-1]
Output: 0
Explanation: The result cannot be 2, because [-2,-1] is not a subarray.
```

Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxProduct(vector<int>& nums) {
        
    }
};
```
