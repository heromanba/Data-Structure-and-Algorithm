Sorted by frequency, only includes green and yellow.

## 1. Two Sum

Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

Example:

Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,

Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,
return [0, 1].

Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> twoSum(vector<int>& nums, int target) {
        
    }
};
```

## 4. Median of Two Sorted Arrays

There are two sorted arrays nums1 and nums2 of size m and n respectively.

Find the median of the two sorted arrays. The overall run time complexity should be O(log (m+n)).

You may assume nums1 and nums2 cannot be both empty.

Example 1:
```
nums1 = [1, 3]
nums2 = [2]

The median is 2.0
```
Example 2:
```
nums1 = [1, 2]
nums2 = [3, 4]

The median is (2 + 3)/2 = 2.5
```

Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    double findMedianSortedArrays(vector<int>& nums1, vector<int>& nums2) {
        
    }
};
```

## 11. Container With Most Water

Given n non-negative integers a1, a2, ..., an , where each represents a point at coordinate (i, ai). n vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of line i is at (i, ai) and (i, 0). Find two lines, which together with x-axis forms a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Note: You may not slant the container and n is at least 2.

![](https://s3-lc-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2018/07/17/question_11.jpg)

The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49.

Example:
```
Input: [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
Output: 49
```

Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxArea(vector<int>& height) {
        
    }
};
```

## 42. Trapping Rain Water

Given n non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is 1, compute how much water it is able to trap after raining.

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/10/22/rainwatertrap.png)

The above elevation map is represented by array [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]. In this case, 6 units of rain water (blue section) are being trapped. Thanks Marcos for contributing this image!

Example:
```
Input: [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]
Output: 6
```

Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int trap(vector<int>& height) {
        
    }
};
```

## 53. Maximum Subarray

Given an integer array nums, find the contiguous subarray (containing at least one number) which has the largest sum and return its sum.

Example:
```
Input: [-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4],
Output: 6
Explanation: [4,-1,2,1] has the largest sum = 6.
```

Follow up:

If you have figured out the O(n) solution, try coding another solution using the divide and conquer approach, which is more subtle.

Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxSubArray(vector<int>& nums) {
        
    }
};
```

## 15. 3Sum

Given an array nums of n integers, are there elements a, b, c in nums such that a + b + c = 0? Find all unique triplets in the array which gives the sum of zero.

Note:

The solution set must not contain duplicate triplets.

Example:
```
Given array nums = [-1, 0, 1, 2, -1, -4],

A solution set is:
[
  [-1, 0, 1],
  [-1, -1, 2]
]
```

Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<int>> threeSum(vector<int>& nums) {
        
    }
};
```

## 121. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock

Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.

If you were only permitted to complete at most one transaction (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock), design an algorithm to find the maximum profit.

Note that you cannot sell a stock before you buy one.

Example 1:
```
Input: [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
             Not 7-1 = 6, as selling price needs to be larger than buying price.
```

Example 2:
```
Input: [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.
```

Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxProfit(vector<int>& prices) {
        
    }
};
```

## 238. Product of Array Except Self

Given an array nums of n integers where n > 1,  return an array output such that output[i] is equal to the product of all the elements of nums except nums[i].

Example:
```
Input:  [1,2,3,4]
Output: [24,12,8,6]
```

Constraint: It's guaranteed that the product of the elements of any prefix or suffix of the array (including the whole array) fits in a 32 bit integer.

Note: Please solve it without division and in O(n).

Follow up:
Could you solve it with constant space complexity? (The output array does not count as extra space for the purpose of space complexity analysis.)

Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> productExceptSelf(vector<int>& nums) {
        
    }
};
```

## 561. Array Partition I

Given an array of 2n integers, your task is to group these integers into n pairs of integer, say (a1, b1), (a2, b2), ..., (an, bn) which makes sum of min(ai, bi) for all i from 1 to n as large as possible.

Example 1:
```
Input: [1,4,3,2]

Output: 4
Explanation: n is 2, and the maximum sum of pairs is 4 = min(1, 2) + min(3, 4).
```
Note:
- n is a positive integer, which is in the range of [1, 10000].
- All the integers in the array will be in the range of [-10000, 10000].

Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int arrayPairSum(vector<int>& nums) {
        
    }
};
```
