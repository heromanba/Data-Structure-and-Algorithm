# Array

Sorted by frequency, only includes green and yellow.

## 1. Two Sum

Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

Example:

Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,

Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,
return [0, 1].

Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> twoSum(vector<int>& nums, int target) {
        
    }
};
```

## 4. Median of Two Sorted Arrays

There are two sorted arrays nums1 and nums2 of size m and n respectively.

Find the median of the two sorted arrays. The overall run time complexity should be O(log (m+n)).

You may assume nums1 and nums2 cannot be both empty.

Example 1:
```
nums1 = [1, 3]
nums2 = [2]

The median is 2.0
```
Example 2:
```
nums1 = [1, 2]
nums2 = [3, 4]

The median is (2 + 3)/2 = 2.5
```

Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    double findMedianSortedArrays(vector<int>& nums1, vector<int>& nums2) {
        
    }
};
```

## 11. Container With Most Water

Given n non-negative integers a1, a2, ..., an , where each represents a point at coordinate (i, ai). n vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of line i is at (i, ai) and (i, 0). Find two lines, which together with x-axis forms a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Note: You may not slant the container and n is at least 2.

![](https://s3-lc-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2018/07/17/question_11.jpg)

The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49.

Example:
```
Input: [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
Output: 49
```

Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxArea(vector<int>& height) {
        
    }
};
```

## 42. Trapping Rain Water

Given n non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is 1, compute how much water it is able to trap after raining.

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/10/22/rainwatertrap.png)

The above elevation map is represented by array [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]. In this case, 6 units of rain water (blue section) are being trapped. Thanks Marcos for contributing this image!

Example:
```
Input: [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]
Output: 6
```

Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int trap(vector<int>& height) {
        
    }
};
```

## 53. Maximum Subarray

Given an integer array nums, find the contiguous subarray (containing at least one number) which has the largest sum and return its sum.

Example:
```
Input: [-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4],
Output: 6
Explanation: [4,-1,2,1] has the largest sum = 6.
```

Follow up:

If you have figured out the O(n) solution, try coding another solution using the divide and conquer approach, which is more subtle.

Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxSubArray(vector<int>& nums) {
        
    }
};
```

## 15. 3Sum

Given an array nums of n integers, are there elements a, b, c in nums such that a + b + c = 0? Find all unique triplets in the array which gives the sum of zero.

Note:

The solution set must not contain duplicate triplets.

Example:
```
Given array nums = [-1, 0, 1, 2, -1, -4],

A solution set is:
[
  [-1, 0, 1],
  [-1, -1, 2]
]
```

Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<int>> threeSum(vector<int>& nums) {
        
    }
};
```

## 121. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock

Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.

If you were only permitted to complete at most one transaction (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock), design an algorithm to find the maximum profit.

Note that you cannot sell a stock before you buy one.

Example 1:
```
Input: [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
             Not 7-1 = 6, as selling price needs to be larger than buying price.
```

Example 2:
```
Input: [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.
```

Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxProfit(vector<int>& prices) {
        
    }
};
```

## 238. Product of Array Except Self

Given an array nums of n integers where n > 1,  return an array output such that output[i] is equal to the product of all the elements of nums except nums[i].

Example:
```
Input:  [1,2,3,4]
Output: [24,12,8,6]
```

Constraint: It's guaranteed that the product of the elements of any prefix or suffix of the array (including the whole array) fits in a 32 bit integer.

Note: Please solve it without division and in O(n).

Follow up:
Could you solve it with constant space complexity? (The output array does not count as extra space for the purpose of space complexity analysis.)

Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> productExceptSelf(vector<int>& nums) {
        
    }
};
```

## 561. Array Partition I

Given an array of 2n integers, your task is to group these integers into n pairs of integer, say (a1, b1), (a2, b2), ..., (an, bn) which makes sum of min(ai, bi) for all i from 1 to n as large as possible.

Example 1:
```
Input: [1,4,3,2]

Output: 4
Explanation: n is 2, and the maximum sum of pairs is 4 = min(1, 2) + min(3, 4).
```
Note:
- n is a positive integer, which is in the range of [1, 10000].
- All the integers in the array will be in the range of [-10000, 10000].

Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int arrayPairSum(vector<int>& nums) {
        
    }
};
```


## 85. Maximal Rectangle

Given a 2D binary matrix filled with 0's and 1's, find the largest rectangle containing only 1's and return its area.

Example:
```
Input:
[
  ["1","0","1","0","0"],
  ["1","0","1","1","1"],
  ["1","1","1","1","1"],
  ["1","0","0","1","0"]
]
Output: 6
```

Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maximalRectangle(vector<vector<char>>& matrix) {
        
    }
};
```

## 169. Majority Element

Given an array of size n, find the majority element. The majority element is the element that appears more than ⌊ n/2 ⌋ times.

You may assume that the array is non-empty and the majority element always exist in the array.

Example 1:
```
Input: [3,2,3]
Output: 3
```
Example 2:
```
Input: [2,2,1,1,1,2,2]
Output: 2
```

Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int majorityElement(vector<int>& nums) {
        
    }
};
```

## 66. Plus One

Given a non-empty array of digits representing a non-negative integer, increment one to the integer.

The digits are stored such that the most significant digit is at the head of the list, and each element in the array contains a single digit.

You may assume the integer does not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.

Example 1:
```
Input: [1,2,3]
Output: [1,2,4]
Explanation: The array represents the integer 123.
```
Example 2:
```
Input: [4,3,2,1]
Output: [4,3,2,2]
Explanation: The array represents the integer 4321.
```

Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> plusOne(vector<int>& digits) {
        
    }
};
```

## 56. Merge Intervals

Given a collection of intervals, merge all overlapping intervals.

Example 1:
```
Input: [[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
Output: [[1,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
Explanation: Since intervals [1,3] and [2,6] overlaps, merge them into [1,6].
```
Example 2:
```
Input: [[1,4],[4,5]]
Output: [[1,5]]
Explanation: Intervals [1,4] and [4,5] are considered overlapping.
```
NOTE: input types have been changed on April 15, 2019. Please reset to default code definition to get new method signature.

Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<int>> merge(vector<vector<int>>& intervals) {
        
    }
};
```

## 88. Merge Sorted Array

Given two sorted integer arrays nums1 and nums2, merge nums2 into nums1 as one sorted array.

Note:

- The number of elements initialized in nums1 and nums2 are m and n respectively.
- You may assume that nums1 has enough space (size that is equal to m + n) to hold additional elements from nums2.

Example:
```
Input:
nums1 = [1,2,3,0,0,0], m = 3
nums2 = [2,5,6],       n = 3

Output: [1,2,2,3,5,6]
```

Constraints:

- -10^9 <= nums1[i], nums2[i] <= 10^9
- nums1.length == m + n
- nums2.length == n

Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    void merge(vector<int>& nums1, int m, vector<int>& nums2, int n) {
        
    }
};
```

## 16. 3Sum Closest

Given an array nums of n integers and an integer target, find three integers in nums such that the sum is closest to target. Return the sum of the three integers. You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution.


Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [-1,2,1,-4], target = 1
Output: 2
Explanation: The sum that is closest to the target is 2. (-1 + 2 + 1 = 2).
```

Constraints:

- 3 <= nums.length <= 10^3
- -10^3 <= nums[i] <= 10^3
- -10^4 <= target <= 10^4

Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int threeSumClosest(vector<int>& nums, int target) {
        
    }
};
```


## 283. Move Zeroes

Given an array nums, write a function to move all 0's to the end of it while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements.

Example:
```
Input: [0,1,0,3,12]
Output: [1,3,12,0,0]
```
Note:

- You must do this in-place without making a copy of the array.
- Minimize the total number of operations.

Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    void moveZeroes(vector<int>& nums) {
        
    }
};
```

## 122. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock II

Say you have an array prices for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.

Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete as many transactions as you like (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock multiple times).

Note: You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).

Example 1:
```        
Input: [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 7
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 3 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
             Then buy on day 4 (price = 3) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-3 = 3.
```
Example 2:
```
Input: [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 4
Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
             Note that you cannot buy on day 1, buy on day 2 and sell them later, as you are
             engaging multiple transactions at the same time. You must sell before buying again.
```
Example 3:
```
Input: [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.
```


Constraints:

- 1 <= prices.length <= 3 * 10 ^ 4
- 0 <= prices[i] <= 10 ^ 4

Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxProfit(vector<int>& prices) {
        
    }
};
```

## 31. Next Permutation

Implement next permutation, which rearranges numbers into the lexicographically next greater permutation of numbers.

If such arrangement is not possible, it must rearrange it as the lowest possible order (ie, sorted in ascending order).

The replacement must be in-place and use only constant extra memory.

Here are some examples. Inputs are in the left-hand column and its corresponding outputs are in the right-hand column.

```
1,2,3 → 1,3,2
3,2,1 → 1,2,3
1,1,5 → 1,5,1
```

Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    void nextPermutation(vector<int>& nums) {
        
    }
};
```

## 48. Rotate Image

You are given an n x n 2D matrix representing an image.

Rotate the image by 90 degrees (clockwise).

Note:

You have to rotate the image in-place, which means you have to modify the input 2D matrix directly. DO NOT allocate another 2D matrix and do the rotation.

Example 1:
```
Given input matrix = 
[
  [1,2,3],
  [4,5,6],
  [7,8,9]
],

rotate the input matrix in-place such that it becomes:
[
  [7,4,1],
  [8,5,2],
  [9,6,3]
]
```
Example 2:
```
Given input matrix =
[
  [ 5, 1, 9,11],
  [ 2, 4, 8,10],
  [13, 3, 6, 7],
  [15,14,12,16]
], 

rotate the input matrix in-place such that it becomes:
[
  [15,13, 2, 5],
  [14, 3, 4, 1],
  [12, 6, 8, 9],
  [16, 7,10,11]
]
```

Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    void rotate(vector<vector<int>>& matrix) {
        
    }
};
```

## 289. Game of Life

According to the Wikipedia's article: "The Game of Life, also known simply as Life, is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970."

Given a board with m by n cells, each cell has an initial state live (1) or dead (0). Each cell interacts with its eight neighbors (horizontal, vertical, diagonal) using the following four rules (taken from the above Wikipedia article):

- Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if caused by under-population.
- Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.
- Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by over-population..
- Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

Write a function to compute the next state (after one update) of the board given its current state. The next state is created by applying the above rules simultaneously to every cell in the current state, where births and deaths occur simultaneously.

Example:
```
Input: 
[
  [0,1,0],
  [0,0,1],
  [1,1,1],
  [0,0,0]
]
Output: 
[
  [0,0,0],
  [1,0,1],
  [0,1,1],
  [0,1,0]
]
```
Follow up:

- Could you solve it in-place? Remember that the board needs to be updated at the same time: You cannot update some cells first and then use their updated values to update other cells.
- In this question, we represent the board using a 2D array. In principle, the board is infinite, which would cause problems when the active area encroaches the border of the array. How would you address these problems?

Solution:

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    void gameOfLife(vector<vector<int>>& board) {
        
    }
};
```

## 128. Longest Consecutive Sequence

Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.

Your algorithm should run in O(n) complexity.

Example:
```
Input: [100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2]
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest consecutive elements sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4]. Therefore its length is 4.
```

Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int longestConsecutive(vector<int>& nums) {
        
    }
};
```

## 41. First Missing Positive

Given an unsorted integer array, find the smallest missing positive integer.

Example 1:
```
Input: [1,2,0]
Output: 3
```
Example 2:
```
Input: [3,4,-1,1]
Output: 2
```
Example 3:
```
Input: [7,8,9,11,12]
Output: 1
```
Note:

Your algorithm should run in O(n) time and uses constant extra space.

Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int firstMissingPositive(vector<int>& nums) {
        
    }
};
```

## 152. Maximum Product Subarray

Given an integer array nums, find the contiguous subarray within an array (containing at least one number) which has the largest product.

Example 1:
```
Input: [2,3,-2,4]
Output: 6
Explanation: [2,3] has the largest product 6.
```
Example 2:
```
Input: [-2,0,-1]
Output: 0
Explanation: The result cannot be 2, because [-2,-1] is not a subarray.
```

Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxProduct(vector<int>& nums) {
        
    }
};
```

## 442. Find All Duplicates in an Array

Given an array of integers, 1 ≤ a[i] ≤ n (n = size of array), some elements appear twice and others appear once.

Find all the elements that appear twice in this array.

Could you do it without extra space and in O(n) runtime?

Example:
```
Input:
[4,3,2,7,8,2,3,1]

Output:
[2,3]
```

Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> findDuplicates(vector<int>& nums) {
        
    }
};
```

## 54. Spiral Matrix

Given a matrix of m x n elements (m rows, n columns), return all elements of the matrix in spiral order.

Example 1:
```
Input:
[
 [ 1, 2, 3 ],
 [ 4, 5, 6 ],
 [ 7, 8, 9 ]
]
Output: [1,2,3,6,9,8,7,4,5]
```
Example 2:
```
Input:
[
  [1, 2, 3, 4],
  [5, 6, 7, 8],
  [9,10,11,12]
]
Output: [1,2,3,4,8,12,11,10,9,5,6,7]
```

Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> spiralOrder(vector<vector<int>>& matrix) {
        
    }
};
```

## 39. Combination Sum

Given a set of candidate numbers (candidates) (without duplicates) and a target number (target), find all unique combinations in candidates where the candidate numbers sums to target.

The same repeated number may be chosen from candidates unlimited number of times.

Note:

All numbers (including target) will be positive integers.
The solution set must not contain duplicate combinations.
Example 1:
```
Input: candidates = [2,3,6,7], target = 7,
A solution set is:
[
  [7],
  [2,2,3]
]
```
Example 2:
```
Input: candidates = [2,3,5], target = 8,
A solution set is:
[
  [2,2,2,2],
  [2,3,3],
  [3,5]
]
```

Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<int>> combinationSum(vector<int>& candidates, int target) {
        
    }
};
```

## 26. Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array

Given a sorted array nums, remove the duplicates in-place such that each element appear only once and return the new length.

Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.

Example 1:
```
Given nums = [1,1,2],

Your function should return length = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 1 and 2 respectively.

It doesn't matter what you leave beyond the returned length.
```

Example 2:
```
Given nums = [0,0,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4],

Your function should return length = 5, with the first five elements of nums being modified to 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively.

It doesn't matter what values are set beyond the returned length.
```
Clarification:

Confused why the returned value is an integer but your answer is an array?

Note that the input array is passed in by reference, which means modification to the input array will be known to the caller as well.

Internally you can think of this:
```
// nums is passed in by reference. (i.e., without making a copy)
int len = removeDuplicates(nums);

// any modification to nums in your function would be known by the caller.
// using the length returned by your function, it prints the first len elements.
for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {
    print(nums[i]);
}
```

Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int removeDuplicates(vector<int>& nums) {
        
    }
};
```

## 118. Pascal's Triangle

Given a non-negative integer numRows, generate the first numRows of Pascal's triangle.

![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0d/PascalTriangleAnimated2.gif)

In Pascal's triangle, each number is the sum of the two numbers directly above it.

Example:
```
Input: 5
Output:
[
     [1],
    [1,1],
   [1,2,1],
  [1,3,3,1],
 [1,4,6,4,1]
]
```

Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<int>> generate(int numRows) {
        
    }
};
```

## 33. Search in Rotated Sorted Array

Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.

(i.e., [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might become [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]).

You are given a target value to search. If found in the array return its index, otherwise return -1.

You may assume no duplicate exists in the array.

Your algorithm's runtime complexity must be in the order of O(log n).

Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 0
Output: 4
```
Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 3
Output: -1
```

Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int search(vector<int>& nums, int target) {
        
    }
};
```

## 621. Task Scheduler

You are given a char array representing tasks CPU need to do. It contains capital letters A to Z where each letter represents a different task. Tasks could be done without the original order of the array. Each task is done in one unit of time. For each unit of time, the CPU could complete either one task or just be idle.

However, there is a non-negative integer n that represents the cooldown period between two same tasks (the same letter in the array), that is that there must be at least n units of time between any two same tasks.

You need to return the least number of units of times that the CPU will take to finish all the given tasks.

 

Example 1:
```
Input: tasks = ["A","A","A","B","B","B"], n = 2
Output: 8
Explanation: 
A -> B -> idle -> A -> B -> idle -> A -> B
There is at least 2 units of time between any two same tasks.
```
Example 2:
```
Input: tasks = ["A","A","A","B","B","B"], n = 0
Output: 6
Explanation: On this case any permutation of size 6 would work since n = 0.
["A","A","A","B","B","B"]
["A","B","A","B","A","B"]
["B","B","B","A","A","A"]
...
And so on.
```

Example 3:
```
Input: tasks = ["A","A","A","A","A","A","B","C","D","E","F","G"], n = 2
Output: 16
Explanation: 
One possible solution is
A -> B -> C -> A -> D -> E -> A -> F -> G -> A -> idle -> idle -> A -> idle -> idle -> A
```

Constraints:

- The number of tasks is in the range [1, 10000].
- The integer n is in the range [0, 100].

Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int leastInterval(vector<char>& tasks, int n) {
        
    }
};
```

## 448. Find All Numbers Disappeared in an Array

Given an array of integers where 1 ≤ a[i] ≤ n (n = size of array), some elements appear twice and others appear once.

Find all the elements of [1, n] inclusive that do not appear in this array.

Could you do it without extra space and in O(n) runtime? You may assume the returned list does not count as extra space.

Example:
```
Input:
[4,3,2,7,8,2,3,1]

Output:
[5,6]
```

Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> findDisappearedNumbers(vector<int>& nums) {
        
    }
};
```

## 167. Two Sum II - Input array is sorted

Given an array of integers that is already sorted in ascending order, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number.

The function twoSum should return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to the target, where index1 must be less than index2.

Note:

- Your returned answers (both index1 and index2) are not zero-based.
- You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution and you may not use the same element twice.

Example:
```
Input: numbers = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [1,2]
Explanation: The sum of 2 and 7 is 9. Therefore index1 = 1, index2 = 2.
```

Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> twoSum(vector<int>& numbers, int target) {
        
    }
};
```

## 18. 4Sum

Given an array nums of n integers and an integer target, are there elements a, b, c, and d in nums such that a + b + c + d = target? Find all unique quadruplets in the array which gives the sum of target.

Note:

The solution set must not contain duplicate quadruplets.

Example:
```
Given array nums = [1, 0, -1, 0, -2, 2], and target = 0.

A solution set is:
[
  [-1,  0, 0, 1],
  [-2, -1, 1, 2],
  [-2,  0, 0, 2]
]
```

Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<int>> fourSum(vector<int>& nums, int target) {
        
    }
};
```

## 79. Word Search
 
Given a 2D board and a word, find if the word exists in the grid.

The word can be constructed from letters of sequentially adjacent cell, where "adjacent" cells are those horizontally or vertically neighboring. The same letter cell may not be used more than once.

Example:
```
board =
[
  ['A','B','C','E'],
  ['S','F','C','S'],
  ['A','D','E','E']
]

Given word = "ABCCED", return true.
Given word = "SEE", return true.
Given word = "ABCB", return false.
```

Constraints:

- board and word consists only of lowercase and uppercase English letters.
- 1 <= board.length <= 200
- 1 <= board[i].length <= 200
- 1 <= word.length <= 10^3

Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool exist(vector<vector<char>>& board, string word) {
        
    }
};
```

## 219. Contains Duplicate II
 
Given an array of integers and an integer k, find out whether there are two distinct indices i and j in the array such that nums[i] = nums[j] and the absolute difference between i and j is at most k.

Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,1], k = 3
Output: true
```
Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [1,0,1,1], k = 1
Output: true
```
Example 3:
```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,1,2,3], k = 2
Output: false
```

Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool containsNearbyDuplicate(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        
    }
};
```

## 27. Remove Element

Given an array nums and a value val, remove all instances of that value in-place and return the new length.

Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.

The order of elements can be changed. It doesn't matter what you leave beyond the new length.

Example 1:
```
Given nums = [3,2,2,3], val = 3,

Your function should return length = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 2.

It doesn't matter what you leave beyond the returned length.
```

Example 2:
```
Given nums = [0,1,2,2,3,0,4,2], val = 2,

Your function should return length = 5, with the first five elements of nums containing 0, 1, 3, 0, and 4.

Note that the order of those five elements can be arbitrary.

It doesn't matter what values are set beyond the returned length.
```
Clarification:

Confused why the returned value is an integer but your answer is an array?

Note that the input array is passed in by reference, which means modification to the input array will be known to the caller as well.

Internally you can think of this:
```
// nums is passed in by reference. (i.e., without making a copy)
int len = removeElement(nums, val);

// any modification to nums in your function would be known by the caller.
// using the length returned by your function, it prints the first len elements.
for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {
    print(nums[i]);
}
```

Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int removeElement(vector<int>& nums, int val) {
        
    }
};
```

## 78. Subsets

Given a set of distinct integers, nums, return all possible subsets (the power set).

Note: The solution set must not contain duplicate subsets.

Example:
```
Input: nums = [1,2,3]
Output:
[
  [3],
  [1],
  [2],
  [1,2,3],
  [1,3],
  [2,3],
  [1,2],
  []
]
```

Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<int>> subsets(vector<int>& nums) {
        
    }
};
```

## 229. Majority Element II

Given an integer array of size n, find all elements that appear more than ⌊ n/3 ⌋ times.

Note: The algorithm should run in linear time and in O(1) space.

Example 1:
```
Input: [3,2,3]
Output: [3]
```
Example 2:
```
Input: [1,1,1,3,3,2,2,2]
Output: [1,2]
```
Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> majorityElement(vector<int>& nums) {
        
    }
};
```

## 217. Contains Duplicate

Given an array of integers, find if the array contains any duplicates.

Your function should return true if any value appears at least twice in the array, and it should return false if every element is distinct.

Example 1:
```
Input: [1,2,3,1]
Output: true
```
Example 2:
```
Input: [1,2,3,4]
Output: false
```
Example 3:
```
Input: [1,1,1,3,3,4,3,2,4,2]
Output: true
```

Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool containsDuplicate(vector<int>& nums) {
        
    }
};
```

## 287. Find the Duplicate Number

Given an array nums containing n + 1 integers where each integer is between 1 and n (inclusive), prove that at least one duplicate number must exist. Assume that there is only one duplicate number, find the duplicate one.

Example 1:
```
Input: [1,3,4,2,2]
Output: 2
```
Example 2:
```
Input: [3,1,3,4,2]
Output: 3
```
Note:

- You must not modify the array (assume the array is read only).
- You must use only constant, O(1) extra space.
- Your runtime complexity should be less than O(n2).
- There is only one duplicate number in the array, but it could be repeated more than once.

Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int findDuplicate(vector<int>& nums) {
        
    }
};
```

## 120. Triangle

Given a triangle, find the minimum path sum from top to bottom. Each step you may move to adjacent numbers on the row below.

For example, given the following triangle
```
[
     [2],
    [3,4],
   [6,5,7],
  [4,1,8,3]
]
```
The minimum path sum from top to bottom is 11 (i.e., 2 + 3 + 5 + 1 = 11).

Note:

Bonus point if you are able to do this using only O(n) extra space, where n is the total number of rows in the triangle.

Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minimumTotal(vector<vector<int>>& triangle) {
        
    }
};
```

## 59. Spiral Matrix II

Given a positive integer n, generate a square matrix filled with elements from 1 to n2 in spiral order.

Example:
```
Input: 3
Output:
[
 [ 1, 2, 3 ],
 [ 8, 9, 4 ],
 [ 7, 6, 5 ]
]
```

Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<int>> generateMatrix(int n) {
        
    }
};
```

## 64. Minimum Path Sum

Given a m x n grid filled with non-negative numbers, find a path from top left to bottom right which minimizes the sum of all numbers along its path.

Note: You can only move either down or right at any point in time.

Example:
```
Input:
[
  [1,3,1],
  [1,5,1],
  [4,2,1]
]
Output: 7
Explanation: Because the path 1→3→1→1→1 minimizes the sum.
```

Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minPathSum(vector<vector<int>>& grid) {
        
    }
};
```

## 228. Summary Ranges

Given a sorted integer array without duplicates, return the summary of its ranges.

Example 1:
```
Input:  [0,1,2,4,5,7]
Output: ["0->2","4->5","7"]
Explanation: 0,1,2 form a continuous range; 4,5 form a continuous range.
```
Example 2:
```
Input:  [0,2,3,4,6,8,9]
Output: ["0","2->4","6","8->9"]
Explanation: 2,3,4 form a continuous range; 8,9 form a continuous range.
```

Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<string> summaryRanges(vector<int>& nums) {
        
    }
};
```

## 105. Construct Binary Tree from Preorder and Inorder Traversal
 
Given preorder and inorder traversal of a tree, construct the binary tree.

Note:
You may assume that duplicates do not exist in the tree.

For example, given
```
preorder = [3,9,20,15,7]
inorder = [9,3,15,20,7]
```
Return the following binary tree:
```
    3
   / \
  9  20
    /  \
   15   7
```

Solution:
```cpp
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x, TreeNode *left, TreeNode *right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    TreeNode* buildTree(vector<int>& preorder, vector<int>& inorder) {
        
    }
};
```

## 45. Jump Game II

Given an array of non-negative integers, you are initially positioned at the first index of the array.

Each element in the array represents your maximum jump length at that position.

Your goal is to reach the last index in the minimum number of jumps.

Example:
```
Input: [2,3,1,1,4]
Output: 2
Explanation: The minimum number of jumps to reach the last index is 2.
    Jump 1 step from index 0 to 1, then 3 steps to the last index.
```

Note:

You can assume that you can always reach the last index.

Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int jump(vector<int>& nums) {
        
    }
};
```

## 153. Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array

Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.

(i.e.,  [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might become  [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]).

Find the minimum element.

You may assume no duplicate exists in the array.

Example 1:
```
Input: [3,4,5,1,2] 
Output: 1
```

Example 2:
```
Input: [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]
Output: 0
```

Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int findMin(vector<int>& nums) {
        
    }
};
```

## 950. Reveal Cards In Increasing Order

In a deck of cards, every card has a unique integer.  You can order the deck in any order you want.

Initially, all the cards start face down (unrevealed) in one deck.

Now, you do the following steps repeatedly, until all cards are revealed:

- Take the top card of the deck, reveal it, and take it out of the deck.
- If there are still cards in the deck, put the next top card of the deck at the bottom of the deck.
- If there are still unrevealed cards, go back to step 1.  Otherwise, stop.

Return an ordering of the deck that would reveal the cards in increasing order.

The first entry in the answer is considered to be the top of the deck.

Example 1:
```
Input: [17,13,11,2,3,5,7]
Output: [2,13,3,11,5,17,7]
Explanation: 
We get the deck in the order [17,13,11,2,3,5,7] (this order doesn't matter), and reorder it.
After reordering, the deck starts as [2,13,3,11,5,17,7], where 2 is the top of the deck.
We reveal 2, and move 13 to the bottom.  The deck is now [3,11,5,17,7,13].
We reveal 3, and move 11 to the bottom.  The deck is now [5,17,7,13,11].
We reveal 5, and move 17 to the bottom.  The deck is now [7,13,11,17].
We reveal 7, and move 13 to the bottom.  The deck is now [11,17,13].
We reveal 11, and move 17 to the bottom.  The deck is now [13,17].
We reveal 13, and move 17 to the bottom.  The deck is now [17].
We reveal 17.
Since all the cards revealed are in increasing order, the answer is correct.
```

Note:

- 1 <= A.length <= 1000
- 1 <= A[i] <= 10^6
- A[i] != A[j] for all i != j

Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> deckRevealedIncreasing(vector<int>& deck) {
        
    }
};
```

## 560. Subarray Sum Equals K

Given an array of integers and an integer k, you need to find the total number of continuous subarrays whose sum equals to k.

Example 1:
```
Input:nums = [1,1,1], k = 2
Output: 2
```

Constraints:

- The length of the array is in range [1, 20,000].
- The range of numbers in the array is [-1000, 1000] and the range of the integer k is [-1e7, 1e7].

Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int subarraySum(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        
    }
};
```

## 695. Max Area of Island

Given a non-empty 2D array grid of 0's and 1's, an island is a group of 1's (representing land) connected 4-directionally (horizontal or vertical.) You may assume all four edges of the grid are surrounded by water.

Find the maximum area of an island in the given 2D array. (If there is no island, the maximum area is 0.)

Example 1:
```
[[0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0],
 [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0],
 [0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],
 [0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0],
 [0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0],
 [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0],
 [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0],
 [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0]]
```

Given the above grid, return 6. Note the answer is not 11, because the island must be connected 4-directionally.

Example 2:
```
[[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]]
```
Given the above grid, return 0.

Note: The length of each dimension in the given grid does not exceed 50.

Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxAreaOfIsland(vector<vector<int>>& grid) {
        
    }
};
```

## 268. Missing Number

Given an array containing n distinct numbers taken from 0, 1, 2, ..., n, find the one that is missing from the array.

Example 1:
```
Input: [3,0,1]
Output: 2
```
Example 2:
```
Input: [9,6,4,2,3,5,7,0,1]
Output: 8
```
Note:

Your algorithm should run in linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it using only constant extra space complexity?

Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int missingNumber(vector<int>& nums) {
        
    }
};
```

## 123. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock III

Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.

Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete at most two transactions.

Note: You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).

Example 1:
```
Input: [3,3,5,0,0,3,1,4]
Output: 6
Explanation: Buy on day 4 (price = 0) and sell on day 6 (price = 3), profit = 3-0 = 3.
             Then buy on day 7 (price = 1) and sell on day 8 (price = 4), profit = 4-1 = 3.
```
Example 2:
```
Input: [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 4
Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
             Note that you cannot buy on day 1, buy on day 2 and sell them later, as you are
             engaging multiple transactions at the same time. You must sell before buying again.
```
Example 3:
```
Input: [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.
```

Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxProfit(vector<int>& prices) {
        
    }
};
```

## 697. Degree of an Array

Given a non-empty array of non-negative integers nums, the degree of this array is defined as the maximum frequency of any one of its elements.

Your task is to find the smallest possible length of a (contiguous) subarray of nums, that has the same degree as nums.

Example 1:
```
Input: [1, 2, 2, 3, 1]
Output: 2
Explanation: 
The input array has a degree of 2 because both elements 1 and 2 appear twice.
Of the subarrays that have the same degree:
[1, 2, 2, 3, 1], [1, 2, 2, 3], [2, 2, 3, 1], [1, 2, 2], [2, 2, 3], [2, 2]
The shortest length is 2. So return 2.
```
Example 2:
```
Input: [1,2,2,3,1,4,2]
Output: 6
```
Note:

- nums.length will be between 1 and 50,000.
- nums[i] will be an integer between 0 and 49,999.

Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int findShortestSubArray(vector<int>& nums) {
        
    }
};
```

## 717. 1-bit and 2-bit Characters

We have two special characters. The first character can be represented by one bit 0. The second character can be represented by two bits (10 or 11).

Now given a string represented by several bits. Return whether the last character must be a one-bit character or not. The given string will always end with a zero.

Example 1:
```
Input: 
bits = [1, 0, 0]
Output: True
Explanation: 
The only way to decode it is two-bit character and one-bit character. 
So the last character is one-bit character.
```
Example 2:
```
Input: 
bits = [1, 1, 1, 0]
Output: False
Explanation: 
The only way to decode it is two-bit character and two-bit character. 
So the last character is NOT one-bit character.
```
Note:

- 1 <= len(bits) <= 1000.
- bits[i] is always 0 or 1.

Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool isOneBitCharacter(vector<int>& bits) {
        
    }
};
```

## 62. Unique Paths

A robot is located at the top-left corner of a m x n grid (marked 'Start' in the diagram below).

The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time. The robot is trying to reach the bottom-right corner of the grid (marked 'Finish' in the diagram below).

How many possible unique paths are there?

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/10/22/robot_maze.png)

Above is a 7 x 3 grid. How many possible unique paths are there?

Example 1:
```
Input: m = 3, n = 2
Output: 3
Explanation:
From the top-left corner, there are a total of 3 ways to reach the bottom-right corner:
1. Right -> Right -> Down
2. Right -> Down -> Right
3. Down -> Right -> Right
```

Example 2:
```
Input: m = 7, n = 3
Output: 28
 ```

Constraints:

- 1 <= m, n <= 100
- It's guaranteed that the answer will be less than or equal to 2 * 10 ^ 9.

Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int uniquePaths(int m, int n) {
        
    }
};
```

## 280. Wiggle Sort

Given an unsorted array nums, reorder it in-place such that nums[0] <= nums[1] >= nums[2] <= nums[3]....

Example:
```
Input: nums = [3,5,2,1,6,4]
Output: One possible answer is [3,5,1,6,2,4]
```

Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    void wiggleSort(vector<int>& nums) {
        
    }
};
```

## 84. Largest Rectangle in Histogram

Given n non-negative integers representing the histogram's bar height where the width of each bar is 1, find the area of largest rectangle in the histogram.

 ![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/10/12/histogram.png)

Above is a histogram where width of each bar is 1, given height = [2,1,5,6,2,3].

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/10/12/histogram_area.png)

The largest rectangle is shown in the shaded area, which has area = 10 unit.

Example:
```
Input: [2,1,5,6,2,3]
Output: 10
```

Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int largestRectangleArea(vector<int>& heights) {
        
    }
};
```

## 75. Sort Colors

Given an array with n objects colored red, white or blue, sort them in-place so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white and blue.

Here, we will use the integers 0, 1, and 2 to represent the color red, white, and blue respectively.

Note: You are not suppose to use the library's sort function for this problem.

Example:
```
Input: [2,0,2,1,1,0]
Output: [0,0,1,1,2,2]
```
Follow up:

- A rather straight forward solution is a two-pass algorithm using counting sort.
First, iterate the array counting number of 0's, 1's, and 2's, then overwrite array with total number of 0's, then 1's and followed by 2's.
- Could you come up with a one-pass algorithm using only constant space?

Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    void sortColors(vector<int>& nums) {
        
    }
};
```

## 73. Set Matrix Zeroes

Given a m x n matrix, if an element is 0, set its entire row and column to 0. Do it in-place.

Example 1:
```
Input: 
[
  [1,1,1],
  [1,0,1],
  [1,1,1]
]
Output: 
[
  [1,0,1],
  [0,0,0],
  [1,0,1]
]
```
Example 2:
```
Input: 
[
  [0,1,2,0],
  [3,4,5,2],
  [1,3,1,5]
]
Output: 
[
  [0,0,0,0],
  [0,4,5,0],
  [0,3,1,0]
]
```
Follow up:

- A straight forward solution using O(mn) space is probably a bad idea.
- A simple improvement uses O(m + n) space, but still not the best solution.
- Could you devise a constant space solution?

Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    void setZeroes(vector<vector<int>>& matrix) {
        
    }
};
```

## 189. Rotate Array

Given an array, rotate the array to the right by k steps, where k is non-negative.

Follow up:

Try to come up as many solutions as you can, there are at least 3 different ways to solve this problem.
Could you do it in-place with O(1) extra space?
 

Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7], k = 3
Output: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]
Explanation:
rotate 1 steps to the right: [7,1,2,3,4,5,6]
rotate 2 steps to the right: [6,7,1,2,3,4,5]
rotate 3 steps to the right: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]
```
Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [-1,-100,3,99], k = 2
Output: [3,99,-1,-100]
Explanation: 
rotate 1 steps to the right: [99,-1,-100,3]
rotate 2 steps to the right: [3,99,-1,-100]
 ```

Constraints:

- 1 <= nums.length <= 2 * 10^4
- It's guaranteed that nums[i] fits in a 32 bit-signed integer.
- k >= 0

Solution:

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    void rotate(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        
    }
};
```
