## 1469. Find All The Lonely Nodes
In a binary tree, a **lonely** node is a node that is the only child of its parent node. The root of the tree is not lonely because it does not have a parent node.

Given the root of a binary tree, return an array containing the values of all lonely nodes in the tree. Return the list **in any order**.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/06/03/e1.png)

```
Input: root = [1,2,3,null,4]
Output: [4]
Explanation: Light blue node is the only lonely node.
Node 1 is the root and is not lonely.
Nodes 2 and 3 have the same parent and are not lonely.
```

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/06/03/e2.png)

```
Input: root = [7,1,4,6,null,5,3,null,null,null,null,null,2]
Output: [6,2]
Explanation: Light blue nodes are lonely nodes.
Please remember that order doesn't matter, [2,6] is also an acceptable answer.
```

**Example 3:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/06/03/tree.png)

```
Input: root = [11,99,88,77,null,null,66,55,null,null,44,33,null,null,22]
Output: [77,55,33,66,44,22]
Explanation: Nodes 99 and 88 share the same parent. Node 11 is the root.
All other nodes are lonely.
```

**Example 4:**
```
Input: root = [197]
Output: []
```

**Example 5:**
```
Input: root = [31,null,78,null,28]
Output: [78,28]
```

**Constraints:**
- The number of nodes in the ```tree``` is in the range ```[1, 1000]```.
- Each node's value is between ```[1, 10^6]```.

**Solution:**

```cpp
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x, TreeNode *left, TreeNode *right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> getLonelyNodes(TreeNode* root) {
        
    }
};
```

## 938. Range Sum of BST
Given the ```root``` node of a binary search tree, return the sum of values of all nodes with value between ```L``` and ```R ``` (inclusive).

The binary search tree is guaranteed to have unique values.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: root = [10,5,15,3,7,null,18], L = 7, R = 15
Output: 32
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: root = [10,5,15,3,7,13,18,1,null,6], L = 6, R = 10
Output: 23
```

**Note:**
- The number of nodes in the tree is at most ```10000```.
- The final answer is guaranteed to be less than ```2^31```.

**Solution:**

```cpp
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x, TreeNode *left, TreeNode *right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    int rangeSumBST(TreeNode* root, int L, int R) {
        
    }
};
```

## 617. Merge Two Binary Trees

Given two binary trees and imagine that when you put one of them to cover the other, some nodes of the two trees are overlapped while the others are not.

You need to merge them into a new binary tree. The merge rule is that if two nodes overlap, then sum node values up as the new value of the merged node. Otherwise, the NOT null node will be used as the node of new tree.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: 
	Tree 1                     Tree 2                  
          1                         2                             
         / \                       / \                            
        3   2                     1   3                        
       /                           \   \                      
      5                             4   7                  
Output: 
Merged tree:
	     3
	    / \
	   4   5
	  / \   \ 
	 5   4   7
```

**Note**: The merging process must start from the root nodes of both trees.

**Solution:**

```cpp
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x, TreeNode *left, TreeNode *right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    TreeNode* mergeTrees(TreeNode* t1, TreeNode* t2) {
        
    }
};
```

## 700. Search in a Binary Search Tree

Given the root node of a binary search tree (BST) and a value. You need to find the node in the BST that the node's value equals the given value. Return the subtree rooted with that node. If such node doesn't exist, you should return NULL.

For example, 

```
Given the tree:
        4
       / \
      2   7
     / \
    1   3

And the value to search: 2
```

You should return this subtree:

```
      2     
     / \   
    1   3
```

In the example above, if we want to search the value ```5```, since there is no node with value ```5```, we should return ```NULL```.

Note that an empty tree is represented by ```NULL```, therefore you would see the expected output (serialized tree format) as ```[]```, not ```null```.

**Solution:**

```cpp
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x, TreeNode *left, TreeNode *right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    TreeNode* searchBST(TreeNode* root, int val) {
        
    }
};
```

## 589. N-ary Tree Preorder Traversal

    Node() {}

    Node(int _val) {
        val = _val;
    }

    Node(int _val, vector<Node*> _children) {
        val = _val;
        children = _children;
    }
};
*/

class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> preorder(Node* root) {
        
    }
};
```

## 590. N-ary Tree Postorder Traversal

Given an n-ary tree, return the postorder traversal of its nodes' values.

Nary-Tree input serialization is represented in their level order traversal, each group of children is separated by the null value (See examples).

    vector<Node*> children;

    Node() {}

    Node(int _val) {
        val = _val;
    }

    Node(int _val, vector<Node*> _children) {
        val = _val;
        children = _children;
    }
};
*/

class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> postorder(Node* root) {
        
    }
};
```

## 897. Increasing Order Search Tree
Given a binary search tree, rearrange the tree in **in-order** so that the leftmost node in the tree is now the root of the tree, and every node has no left child and only 1 right child.

```
Example 1:
Input: [5,3,6,2,4,null,8,1,null,null,null,7,9]

       5
      / \
    3    6

 /        / \ 
1        7   9

Output: [1,null,2,null,3,null,4,null,5,null,6,null,7,null,8,null,9]

 1
  \
   2
    \
     3

- Each node will have a unique integer value from ```0``` to ```1000```.

## 559. Maximum Depth of N-ary Tree

Given a n-ary tree, find its maximum depth.

The maximum depth is the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.

Nary-Tree input serialization is represented in their level order traversal, each group of children is separated by the null value (See examples).

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/10/12/narytreeexample.png)

```
Input: root = [1,null,3,2,4,null,5,6]

class Node {
public:
    int val;
    vector<Node*> children;

    Node() {}

    Node(int _val) {
        val = _val;
    }

    Node(int _val, vector<Node*> _children) {
        val = _val;
        children = _children;
    }
};
*/

class Solution {
public:
    int maxDepth(Node* root) {
        
    }
};
```

## 965. Univalued Binary Tree

A binary tree is univalued if every node in the tree has the same value.

Return ```true``` if and only if the given tree is univalued.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/28/unival_bst_1.png)

```
Input: [1,1,1,1,1,null,1]
Output: true
```

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/28/unival_bst_2.png)

```
Input: [2,2,2,5,2]
Output: false
```

**Note:**

 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    bool isUnivalTree(TreeNode* root) {
        
    }
};
```

## 1022. Sum of Root To Leaf Binary Numbers
Given a binary tree, each node has value ```0``` or ```1```.  Each root-to-leaf path represents a binary number starting with the most significant bit.  For example, if the path is ```0 -> 1 -> 1 -> 0 -> 1```, then this could represent ```01101``` in binary, which is ```13```.

For all leaves in the tree, consider the numbers represented by the path from the root to that leaf.

Return the sum of these numbers.

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/04/04/sum-of-root-to-leaf-binary-numbers.png)

```
Input: [1,0,1,0,1,0,1]
Output: 22
Explanation: (100) + (101) + (110) + (111) = 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 = 22
```

**Note:**
- The number of nodes in the tree is between ```1``` and ```1000```.
- node.val is ``0``` or ```1```.
- The answer will not exceed ```2^31 - 1```.

**Solution:**
```cpp

 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}

 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    int sumRootToLeaf(TreeNode* root) {
        
    }
};
```

## 104. Maximum Depth of Binary Tree

Given a binary tree, find its maximum depth.

The maximum depth is the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.

**Note:** A leaf is a node with no children.

**Example:**

Given binary tree ```[3,9,20,null,null,15,7]```,
```
    3
   / \
  9  20
    /  \
   15   7
```
return its depth = 3.

**Solution:**
```cpp
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x, TreeNode *left, TreeNode *right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    int bottomUp(TreeNode* root) {
        if (!root)
            return 0;
        int left_depth = bottomUp(root->left);
        int right_depth = bottomUp(root->right);
        int depth = max(left_depth, right_depth) + 1;
        return depth;
    }
    
    int maxDepth(TreeNode* root) {
        return bottomUp(root);
        
    }
};
```

## 872. Leaf-Similar Trees
Consider all the leaves of a binary tree.  From left to right order, the values of those leaves form a leaf value sequence.

![](https://s3-lc-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2018/07/16/tree.png)

For example, in the given tree above, the leaf value sequence is ```(6, 7, 4, 9, 8)```.

Two binary trees are considered leaf-similar if their leaf value sequence is the same.

Return ```true``` if and only if the two given trees with head nodes ```root1``` and ```root2``` are leaf-similar.

**Constraints:**

- Both of the given trees will have between ```1``` and ```200``` nodes.

 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}

**Example:**

Input:
```
     4
   /   \
  2     7
 / \   / \
1   3 6   9
```

Output:
```
     4
   /   \
  7     2
 / \   / \
9   6 3   1
```

**Solution:**
```cpp
/**

 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}

    TreeNode* invertTree(TreeNode* root) {
        
    }
};
```

## 669. Trim a Binary Search Tree
Given a binary search tree and the lowest and highest boundaries as ```L``` and ```R```, trim the tree so that all its elements lies in ```[L, R]``` (R >= L). You might need to change the root of the tree, so the result should return the new root of the trimmed binary search tree.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: 
    1
   / \
  0   2

  L = 1
  R = 2

Output: 
    1
      \
       2
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: 
    3
   / \
  0   4
   \
    2
   /
  1

  L = 1
  R = 3

Output: 
      3
     / 
   2   
  /
 1
```

```cpp
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x, TreeNode *left, TreeNode *right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    TreeNode* trimBST(TreeNode* root, int L, int R) {
        
    }
};
```

## 637. Average of Levels in Binary Tree

Given a non-empty binary tree, return the average value of the nodes on each level in the form of an array.

**Example 1:**

```
Input:
    3
   / \
  9  20
    /  \
   15   7
Output: [3, 14.5, 11]
Explanation:
The average value of nodes on level 0 is 3,  on level 1 is 14.5, and on level 2 is 11. Hence return [3, 14.5, 11].
```

**Note:**

- The range of node's value is in the range of 32-bit signed integer.

**Solution:**
```cpp
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x, TreeNode *left, TreeNode *right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    vector<double> averageOfLevels(TreeNode* root) {
        
    }
};
```
