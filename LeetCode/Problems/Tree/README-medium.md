## 1490. Clone N-ary Tree
Given a root of an N-ary tree, return a [deep copy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_copying#Deep_copy) (clone) of the tree.

Each node in the n-ary tree contains a val (int) and a list (List[Node]) of its children.
```
class Node {
    public int val;
    public List<Node> children;
}
```
Nary-Tree input serialization is represented in their level order traversal, each group of children is separated by the null value (See examples).

Follow up: Can your solution work for the [graph problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/clone-graph/)?

Example 1:

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/10/12/narytreeexample.png)

```

Input: root = [1,null,3,2,4,null,5,6]
Output: [1,null,3,2,4,null,5,6]
```

Example 2:

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/11/08/sample_4_964.png)

```
Input: root = [1,null,2,3,4,5,null,null,6,7,null,8,null,9,10,null,
null,11,null,12,null,13,null,null,14]

Output: [1,null,2,3,4,5,null,null,6,7,null,8,null,9,10,null,null,11,null,
12,null,13,null,null,14]
```

Constraints:

- The depth of the n-ary tree is less than or equal to 1000.
- The total number of nodes is between [0, 10^4].

Solution:

```cpp
/*
// Definition for a Node.
class Node {
public:
    int val;
    vector<Node*> children;

    Node() {}

    Node(int _val) {
        val = _val;
    }

    Node(int _val, vector<Node*> _children) {
        val = _val;
        children = _children;
    }
};
*/

class Solution {
public:
    Node* cloneTree(Node* root) {
        
    }
};
```

## 1302. Deepest Leaves Sum

Given a binary tree, return the sum of values of its deepest leaves.
 

Example 1:

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/07/31/1483_ex1.png)

Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5,null,6,7,null,null,null,null,8]
Output: 15

Constraints:

- The number of nodes in the tree is between 1 and 10^4.
- The value of nodes is between 1 and 100.

Solution:

```cpp
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x, TreeNode *left, TreeNode *right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    int deepestLeavesSum(TreeNode* root) {
        
    }
};
```

## 1379. Find a Corresponding Node of a Binary Tree in a Clone of That Tree

Given two binary trees original and cloned and given a reference to a node target in the original tree.

The cloned tree is a copy of the original tree.

Return a reference to the same node in the cloned tree.

Note that you are not allowed to change any of the two trees or the target node and the answer must be a reference to a node in the cloned tree.

Follow up: Solve the problem if repeated values on the tree are allowed.

Example 1:

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/02/21/e1.png)

```
Input: tree = [7,4,3,null,null,6,19], target = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: In all examples the original and cloned trees are shown. The target node is a green node from the original tree. The answer is the yellow node from the cloned tree.
```

Example 2:

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/02/21/e2.png)

```
Input: tree = [7], target =  7
Output: 7
```

Example 3:

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/02/21/e3.png)

```
Input: tree = [8,null,6,null,5,null,4,null,3,null,2,null,1], target = 4
Output: 4
```

Example 4:

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/02/21/e4.png)

```
Input: tree = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10], target = 5
Output: 5
```

Example 5:

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/02/21/e5.png)

```
Input: tree = [1,2,null,3], target = 2
Output: 2
```

Constraints:

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 10^4].
- The values of the nodes of the tree are unique.
- target node is a node from the original tree and is not null.

Solution:

```cpp
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(NULL), right(NULL) {}
 * };
 */

class Solution {
public:
    TreeNode* getTargetCopy(TreeNode* original, TreeNode* cloned, TreeNode* target) {
        
    }
};
```
