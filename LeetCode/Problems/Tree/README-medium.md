## 1490. Clone N-ary Tree
Given a root of an N-ary tree, return a [deep copy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_copying#Deep_copy) (clone) of the tree.

Each node in the n-ary tree contains a val (int) and a list (List[Node]) of its children.
```
class Node {
    public int val;
    public List<Node> children;
}
```
Nary-Tree input serialization is represented in their level order traversal, each group of children is separated by the null value (See examples).

Follow up: Can your solution work for the [graph problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/clone-graph/)?

Example 1:

    Node() {}

    Node(int _val) {
        val = _val;
    }

    Node(int _val, vector<Node*> _children) {
        val = _val;
        children = _children;
    }

    }
};
```

## 1379. Find a Corresponding Node of a Binary Tree in a Clone of That Tree

Given two binary trees original and cloned and given a reference to a node target in the original tree.

The cloned tree is a copy of the original tree.

Return a reference to the same node in the cloned tree.

Note that you are not allowed to change any of the two trees or the target node and the answer must be a reference to a node in the cloned tree.

Follow up: Solve the problem if repeated values on the tree are allowed.

```
Input: tree = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10], target = 5
Output: 5
```

Example 5:

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/02/21/e5.png)

```
Input: tree = [1,2,null,3], target = 2
Output: 2
```

Constraints:

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 10^4].
- The values of the nodes of the tree are unique.
- target node is a node from the original tree and is not null.

Solution:

```cpp
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(NULL), right(NULL) {}
 * };
 */

class Solution {
public:
    TreeNode* getTargetCopy(TreeNode* original, TreeNode* cloned, TreeNode* target) {
        
    }
};
```

## 1315. Sum of Nodes with Even-Valued Grandparent

Given a binary tree, return the sum of values of nodes with even-valued grandparent.  (A grandparent of a node is the parent of its parent, if it exists.)

If there are no nodes with an even-valued grandparent, return 0.

Example 1:

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/07/24/1473_ex1.png)

```
Input: root = [6,7,8,2,7,1,3,9,null,1,4,null,null,null,5]
Output: 18
Explanation: The red nodes are the nodes with even-value grandparent while the 
blue nodes are the even-value grandparents.
```

Constraints:

- The number of nodes in the tree is between 1 and 10^4.
- The value of nodes is between 1 and 100.

Solution:

```cpp
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x, TreeNode *left, TreeNode *right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    int sumEvenGrandparent(TreeNode* root) {
        
    }
};
```

## 1485. Clone Binary Tree With Random Pointer

A binary tree is given such that each node contains an additional random pointer which could point to any node in the tree or null.

Return a deep copy of the tree.

The tree is represented in the same input/output way as normal binary trees where each node is represented as a pair of [val, random_index] where:

- val: an integer representing Node.val
- random_index: the index of the node (in the input) where the random pointer points to, or null if it does not point to any node.

You will be given the tree in class Node and you should return the cloned tree in class NodeCopy. NodeCopy class is just a clone of Node class with the same attributes and constructors.

Example 1:

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/06/17/clone_1.png)

```
Input: root = [[1,null],null,[4,3],[7,0]]
Output: [[1,null],null,[4,3],[7,0]]
Explanation: The original binary tree is [1,null,4,7].
The random pointer of node one is null, so it is represented as [1, null].
The random pointer of node 4 is node 7, so it is represented as [4, 3] 
where 3 is the index of node 7 in the array representing the tree.

The random pointer of node 7 is node 1, so it is represented as [7, 0] 
where 0 is the index of node 1 in the array representing the tree.
```

Example 2:

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/06/17/clone_2.png)

```
Input: root = [[1,4],null,[1,0],null,[1,5],[1,5]]
Output: [[1,4],null,[1,0],null,[1,5],[1,5]]
Explanation: The random pointer of a node can be the node itself.
```

Example 3:

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/06/17/clone_3.png)

```
Input: root = [[1,6],[2,5],[3,4],[4,3],[5,2],[6,1],[7,0]]
Output: [[1,6],[2,5],[3,4],[4,3],[5,2],[6,1],[7,0]]
```

Example 4:
```
Input: root = []
Output: []
```

Example 5:
```
Input: root = [[1,null],null,[2,null],null,[1,null]]
Output: [[1,null],null,[2,null],null,[1,null]]
```

Constraints:

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 1000].
- Each node's value is between [1, 10^6].

Solution:
```cpp
/**
 * Definition for a Node.
 * struct Node {
 *     int val;
 *     Node *left;
 *     Node *right;
 *     Node *random;
 *     Node() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr), random(nullptr) {}
 *     Node(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr), random(nullptr) {}
 *     Node(int x, Node *left, Node *right, Node *random) : val(x), left(left), right(right), random(random) {}
 * };
 */

class Solution {
public:
    NodeCopy* copyRandomBinaryTree(Node* root) {
        
    }
};
```

## 654. Maximum Binary Tree
Given an integer array with no duplicates. A maximum tree building on this array is defined as follow:

- The root is the maximum number in the array.
- The left subtree is the maximum tree constructed from left part subarray divided by the maximum number.
- The right subtree is the maximum tree constructed from right part subarray divided by the maximum number.

Construct the maximum tree by the given array and output the root node of this tree.

Example 1:
```
Input: [3,2,1,6,0,5]
Output: return the tree root node representing the following tree:

      6
    /   \
   3     5
    \    / 
     2  0   
       \
        1
```

 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    TreeNode* constructMaximumBinaryTree(vector<int>& nums) {
        
    }
};
```

## 1008. Construct Binary Search Tree from Preorder Traversal
Return the root node of a binary search tree that matches the given preorder traversal.

(Recall that a binary search tree is a binary tree where for every node, any descendant of node.left has a value < node.val, and any descendant of node.right has a value > node.val.  Also recall that a preorder traversal displays the value of the node first, then traverses node.left, then traverses node.right.)

It's guaranteed that for the given test cases there is always possible to find a binary search tree with the given requirements.

Example 1:
```
Input: [8,5,1,7,10,12]
Output: [8,5,10,1,7,null,12]
```

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/03/06/1266.png)

Constraints:
- 1 <= preorder.length <= 100
- 1 <= preorder[i] <= 10^8

Solution:
```cpp
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x, TreeNode *left, TreeNode *right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    TreeNode* bstFromPreorder(vector<int>& preorder) {
        
    }
};
```

## 701. Insert into a Binary Search Tree

Given the root node of a binary search tree (BST) and a value to be inserted into the tree, insert the value into the BST. Return the root node of the BST after the insertion. It is guaranteed that the new value does not exist in the original BST.

Note that there may exist multiple valid ways for the insertion, as long as the tree remains a BST after insertion. You can return any of them.

For example, 
```
Given the tree:
        4
       / \
      2   7
     / \
    1   3
And the value to insert: 5
```

You can return this binary search tree:
```
         4
       /   \
      2     7
     / \   /
    1   3 5
```

This tree is also valid:

```
         5
       /   \
      2     7
     / \   
    1   3
         \
          4
 ```

Constraints:

- The number of nodes in the given tree will be between 0 and 10^4.
- Each node will have a unique integer value from 0 to -10^8, inclusive.
- -10^8 <= val <= 10^8
- It's guaranteed that val does not exist in the original BST.

Solution:

```cpp
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x, TreeNode *left, TreeNode *right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}
 * };

## 1261. Find Elements in a Contaminated Binary Tree

Given a binary tree with the following rules:

- root.val == 0
- If treeNode.val == x and treeNode.left != null, then treeNode.left.val == 2 * x + 1
- If treeNode.val == x and treeNode.right != null, then treeNode.right.val == 2 * x + 2
Now the binary tree is contaminated, which means all treeNode.val have been changed to -1.

You need to first recover the binary tree and then implement the FindElements class:

- FindElements(TreeNode* root) Initializes the object with a contamined binary tree, you need to recover it first.
- bool find(int target) Return if the target value exists in the recovered binary tree.

Example 1:

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/11/06/untitled-diagram-4-1.jpg)

Explanation
FindElements findElements = new FindElements([-1,-1,-1,-1,-1]);
findElements.find(1); // return True
findElements.find(3); // return True
findElements.find(5); // return False
```

FindElements findElements = new FindElements([-1,null,-1,-1,null,-1]);
findElements.find(2); // return True
findElements.find(3); // return False
findElements.find(4); // return False
findElements.find(5); // return True
```

Constraints:

- TreeNode.val == -1

## 1325. Delete Leaves With a Given Value

Given a binary tree root and an integer target, delete all the leaf nodes with value target.

Note that once you delete a leaf node with value target, if it's parent node becomes a leaf node and has the value target, it should also be deleted (you need to continue doing that until you can't).

Example 1:

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/01/09/sample_1_1684.png)

```
Input: root = [1,2,3,2,null,2,4], target = 2
Output: [1,null,3,null,4]
Explanation: Leaf nodes in green with value (target = 2) are removed (Picture in left). 
After removing, new nodes become leaf nodes with value (target = 2) (Picture in center).
```

Example 2:

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/01/09/sample_2_1684.png)

```
Input: root = [1,3,3,3,2], target = 3
Output: [1,3,null,null,2]
```

Example 3:

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/01/15/sample_3_1684.png)

```
Input: root = [1,2,null,2,null,2], target = 2
Output: [1]
Explanation: Leaf nodes in green with value (target = 2) are removed at each step.
```

Example 4:
```
Input: root = [1,1,1], target = 1
Output: []
```

Example 5:
```
Input: root = [1,2,3], target = 1
Output: [1,2,3]
```

## 1104. Path In Zigzag Labelled Binary Tree
In an infinite binary tree where every node has two children, the nodes are labelled in row order.

In the odd numbered rows (ie., the first, third, fifth,...), the labelling is left to right, while in the even numbered rows (second, fourth, sixth,...), the labelling is right to left.

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/06/24/tree.png)

Given the label of a node in this tree, return the labels in the path from the root of the tree to the node with that label.

Example 1:
```
Input: label = 14
Output: [1,3,4,14]
```

Example 2:
```
Input: label = 26
Output: [1,2,6,10,26]
```

Constraints:

- 1 <= label <= 10^6

Solution:

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> pathInZigZagTree(int label) {
        
    }
};
```

## 366. Find Leaves of Binary Tree

Given a binary tree, collect a tree's nodes as if you were doing this: Collect and remove all leaves, repeat until the tree is empty.

Example:

```
Input: [1,2,3,4,5]
  
          1
         / \
        2   3
       / \     
      4   5    

Output: [[4,5,3],[2],[1]]
```

Explanation:

1. Removing the leaves [4,5,3] would result in this tree:
```
          1
         / 
        2          
 ```

2. Now removing the leaf [2] would result in this tree:
```
          1          
 ```

3. Now removing the leaf [1] would result in the empty tree:
```
          []  
```

Solution:
```cpp
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x, TreeNode *left, TreeNode *right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<int>> findLeaves(TreeNode* root) {
        
    }
};
```

## 1448. Count Good Nodes in Binary Tree

Given a binary tree root, a node X in the tree is named good if in the path from root to X there are no nodes with a value greater than X.

Return the number of good nodes in the binary tree.

Example 1:

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/04/02/test_sample_1.png)

```
Input: root = [3,1,4,3,null,1,5]
Output: 4
Explanation: Nodes in blue are good.
Root Node (3) is always a good node.
Node 4 -> (3,4) is the maximum value in the path starting from the root.
Node 5 -> (3,4,5) is the maximum value in the path
Node 3 -> (3,1,3) is the maximum value in the path.
```

Example 2:

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/04/02/test_sample_2.png)

```
Input: root = [3,3,null,4,2]
Output: 3
Explanation: Node 2 -> (3, 3, 2) is not good, because "3" is higher than it.
```

Example 3:
```
Input: root = [1]
Output: 1
Explanation: Root is considered as good.
```

Constraints:

- The number of nodes in the binary tree is in the range [1, 10^5].
- Each node's value is between [-10^4, 10^4].

Solution:

```cpp
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {

 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    int goodNodes(TreeNode* root) {
        
    }
};
```

## 979. Distribute Coins in Binary Tree

Given the root of a binary tree with N nodes, each node in the tree has node.val coins, and there are N coins total.

In one move, we may choose two adjacent nodes and move one coin from one node to another.  (The move may be from parent to child, or from child to parent.)

Return the number of moves required to make every node have exactly one coin.

Example 1:

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/01/18/tree1.png)

```
Input: [3,0,0]
Output: 2
Explanation: From the root of the tree, we move one coin to its left child, 
and one coin to its right child.
```

Example 2:

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/01/18/tree2.png)

```cpp
Input: [0,3,0]
Output: 3
Explanation: From the left child of the root, we move two coins to the 
root [taking two moves].  Then, we move one coin from the root of the 
tree to the right child.
```

Example 3:

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/01/18/tree3.png)

```
Input: [1,0,2]
Output: 2
```

Example 4:

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/01/18/tree4.png)

```
Input: [1,0,0,null,3]
Output: 4
```

Note:

- 1<= N <= 100
- 0 <= node.val <= N

Solution:

```cpp
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}

    int distributeCoins(TreeNode* root) {
        
    }
};
```

## 1457. Pseudo-Palindromic Paths in a Binary Tree

Given a binary tree where node values are digits from 1 to 9. A path in the binary tree is said to be pseudo-palindromic if at least one permutation of the node values in the path is a palindrome.

Return the number of pseudo-palindromic paths going from the root node to leaf nodes.

Example 1:

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/05/06/palindromic_paths_1.png)

```
Input: root = [2,3,1,3,1,null,1]
Output: 2 
Explanation: The figure above represents the given binary tree. There are three 
paths going from the root node to leaf nodes: the red path [2,3,3], the green 
path [2,1,1], and the path [2,3,1]. Among these paths only red path and green 
path are pseudo-palindromic paths since the red path [2,3,3] can be rearranged 
in [3,2,3] (palindrome) and the green path [2,1,1] can be rearranged in [1,2,1] 
(palindrome).
```

Example 2:

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/05/07/palindromic_paths_2.png)

```
Input: root = [2,1,1,1,3,null,null,null,null,null,1]
Output: 1 
Explanation: The figure above represents the given binary tree. There are 
three paths going from the root node to leaf nodes: the green path [2,1,1], 
the path [2,1,3,1], and the path [2,1]. Among these paths only the green path 
is pseudo-palindromic since [2,1,1] can be rearranged in [1,2,1] (palindrome).
```
Example 3:
```
Input: root = [9]
Output: 1
```

Constraints:

- The given binary tree will have between 1 and 10^5 nodes.
- Node values are digits from 1 to 9.

Solution:
```cpp
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}

    }
};
```

## 1123. Lowest Common Ancestor of Deepest Leaves
Given a rooted binary tree, return the lowest common ancestor of its deepest leaves.

Recall that:

- The node of a binary tree is a leaf if and only if it has no children
- The depth of the root of the tree is 0, and if the depth of a node is d, the depth of each of its children is d+1.
- The lowest common ancestor of a set S of nodes is the node A with the largest depth such that every node in S is in the subtree with root A.
 

Example 1:
```
Input: root = [1,2,3]
Output: [1,2,3]
Explanation: 
The deepest leaves are the nodes with values 2 and 3.
The lowest common ancestor of these leaves is the node with value 1.
The answer returned is a TreeNode object (not an array) with serialization "[1,2,3]".
```

Example 2:
```
Input: root = [1,2,3,4]
Output: [4]
```

Example 3:
```
Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: [2,4,5]
``` 

Constraints:

- The given tree will have between 1 and 1000 nodes.

 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}

 *     TreeNode(int x, TreeNode *left, TreeNode *right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    TreeNode* lcaDeepestLeaves(TreeNode* root) {
        
    }
};
```

## 1110. Delete Nodes And Return Forest

Given the root of a binary tree, each node in the tree has a distinct value.

After deleting all nodes with a value in to_delete, we are left with a forest (a disjoint union of trees).

Return the roots of the trees in the remaining forest.  You may return the result in any order.

Example 1:

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/07/01/screen-shot-2019-07-01-at-53836-pm.png)
```
Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7], to_delete = [3,5]

```

Constraints:

- The number of nodes in the given tree is at most 1000.
- Each node has a distinct value between 1 and 1000.
- to_delete.length <= 1000
- to_delete contains distinct values between 1 and 1000.

```cpp
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x, TreeNode *left, TreeNode *right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    vector<TreeNode*> delNodes(TreeNode* root, vector<int>& to_delete) {
        
    }
};
```

## 889. Construct Binary Tree from Preorder and Postorder Traversal
Return any binary tree that matches the given preorder and postorder traversals.

Values in the traversals pre and post are distinct positive integers.

 

Example 1:
```
Input: pre = [1,2,4,5,3,6,7], post = [4,5,2,6,7,3,1]
Output: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]
```

Note:

- 1 <= pre.length == post.length <= 30
- pre[] and post[] are both permutations of 1, 2, ..., pre.length.
- It is guaranteed an answer exists. If there exists multiple answers, you can return any of them.

Solution:
```cpp
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}

 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    TreeNode* constructFromPrePost(vector<int>& pre, vector<int>& post) {
        
    }
};
```

## 1130. Minimum Cost Tree From Leaf Values

Given an array arr of positive integers, consider all binary trees such that:

- Each node has either 0 or 2 children;
- The values of arr correspond to the values of each leaf in an in-order traversal of the tree.  (Recall that a node is a leaf if and only if it has 0 children.)
- The value of each non-leaf node is equal to the product of the largest leaf value in its left and right subtree respectively.

Among all possible binary trees considered, return the smallest possible sum of the values of each non-leaf node.  It is guaranteed this sum fits into a 32-bit integer.

Example 1:
```
Input: arr = [6,2,4]
Output: 32
Explanation:
There are two possible trees.  The first has non-leaf node sum 36, 
and the second has non-leaf node sum 32.

    24            24
   /  \          /  \
  12   4        6    8
 /  \               / \
6    2             2   4
```

Constraints:

- 2 <= arr.length <= 40
- 1 <= arr[i] <= 15
- It is guaranteed that the answer fits into a 32-bit signed integer (ie. it is less than 2^31).

Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int mctFromLeafValues(vector<int>& arr) {
        
    }
};
```

## 951. Flip Equivalent Binary Trees

For a binary tree T, we can define a flip operation as follows: choose any node, and swap the left and right child subtrees.

A binary tree X is flip equivalent to a binary tree Y if and only if we can make X equal to Y after some number of flip operations.

Write a function that determines whether two binary trees are flip equivalent.  The trees are given by root nodes root1 and root2.

Example 1:
```
Input: root1 = [1,2,3,4,5,6,null,null,null,7,8], 
root2 = [1,3,2,null,6,4,5,null,null,null,null,8,7]

Output: true

Explanation: We flipped at nodes with values 1, 3, and 5.
```

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/11/29/tree_ex.png)

Note:

- Each tree will have at most 100 nodes.
- Each value in each tree will be a unique integer in the range [0, 99].

Solution:
```cpp
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x, TreeNode *left, TreeNode *right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    bool flipEquiv(TreeNode* root1, TreeNode* root2) {
        
    }
};
```

## 1026. Maximum Difference Between Node and Ancestor

Given the root of a binary tree, find the maximum value V for which there exists different nodes A and B where V = |A.val - B.val| and A is an ancestor of B.

(A node A is an ancestor of B if either: any child of A is equal to B, or any child of A is an ancestor of B.)

Example 1:

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/09/09/2whqcep.jpg)

```
Input: [8,3,10,1,6,null,14,null,null,4,7,13]
Output: 7
Explanation: 
We have various ancestor-node differences, 
some of which are given below :

|8 - 3| = 5
|3 - 7| = 4
|8 - 1| = 7
|10 - 13| = 3

Among all possible differences, 
the maximum value of 7 is obtained by |8 - 1| = 7.
```

Note:

- The number of nodes in the tree is between 2 and 5000.
- Each node will have value between 0 and 100000.

Solution:
```cpp
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x, TreeNode *left, TreeNode *right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}

```

## 429. N-ary Tree Level Order Traversal

## 1466. Reorder Routes to Make All Paths Lead to the City Zero

There are n cities numbered from 0 to n-1 and n-1 roads such that there is only one way to travel between two different cities (this network form a tree). Last year, The ministry of transport decided to orient the roads in one direction because they are too narrow.

Roads are represented by connections where connections[i] = [a, b] represents a road from city a to b.

This year, there will be a big event in the capital (city 0), and many people want to travel to this city.

Your task consists of reorienting some roads such that each city can visit the city 0. Return the minimum number of edges changed.

It's guaranteed that each city can reach the city 0 after reorder.

Example 1:

```
Input: n = 5, connections = [[1,0],[1,2],[3,2],[3,4]]
Output: 2
Explanation: Change the direction of edges show in red such that 
each node can reach the node 0 (capital).
```

Example 3:

```
Input: n = 3, connections = [[1,0],[2,0]]
Output: 0
```

Constraints:

- 2 <= n <= 5 * 10^4
- connections.length == n-1
- connections[i].length == 2
- 0 <= connections[i][0], connections[i][1] <= n-1
- connections[i][0] != connections[i][1]

Input: [1,null,2,3]
   1
    \
     2
    /
   3

Output: [1,3,2]
```

Follow up: Recursive solution is trivial, could you do it iteratively?

Solution:
```cpp

        vec_root.insert(vec_root.end(), vec_left.begin(), vec_left.end());
        
        vec_root.push_back(root->val);
        
        if (root->right != NULL)
            vec_right = inorderTraversal(root->right);

## 998. Maximum Binary Tree II

We are given the root node of a maximum tree: a tree where every node has a value greater than any other value in its subtree.

Just as in the previous problem, the given tree was constructed from an list A (root = Construct(A)) recursively with the following Construct(A) routine:

- If A is empty, return null.
- Otherwise, let A[i] be the largest element of A.  Create a root node with value A[i].
- The left child of root will be Construct([A[0], A[1], ..., A[i-1]])
- The right child of root will be Construct([A[i+1], A[i+2], ..., A[A.length - 1]])
- Return root.

Note that we were not given A directly, only a root node root = Construct(A).

Suppose B is a copy of A with the value val appended to it.  It is guaranteed that B has unique values.

Return Construct(B).

## 1120. Maximum Average Subtree

Given the root of a binary tree, find the maximum average value of any subtree of that tree.

(A subtree of a tree is any node of that tree plus all its descendants. The average value of a tree is the sum of its values, divided by the number of nodes.) 

Example 1:

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/04/09/1308_example_1.png)

```
Input: [5,6,1]
Output: 6.00000
Explanation: 
For the node with value = 5 we have an average of (5 + 6 + 1) / 3 = 4.
For the node with value = 6 we have an average of 6 / 1 = 6.
For the node with value = 1 we have an average of 1 / 1 = 1.
So the answer is 6 which is the maximum.
```

Note:

- The number of nodes in the tree is between 1 and 5000.
- Each node will have a value between 0 and 100000.
- Answers will be accepted as correct if they are within 10^-5 of the correct answer.

Solution:
```cpp
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x, TreeNode *left, TreeNode *right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    double maximumAverageSubtree(TreeNode* root) {
        
    }
};
```

## 513. Find Bottom Left Tree Value

Given a binary tree, find the leftmost value in the last row of the tree.

Example 1:
```
Input:

    2
   / \
  1   3

Output:
1
```

Example 2:
```
Input:

        1
       / \
      2   3
     /   / \
    4   5   6
       /
      7

Output:
7
```
Note: You may assume the tree (i.e., the given root node) is not NULL.

Solution:
```cpp
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x, TreeNode *left, TreeNode *right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    int findBottomLeftValue(TreeNode* root) {
        
    }
};
```

515. Find Largest Value in Each Tree Row

You need to find the largest value in each row of a binary tree.

Example:
```
Input: 

          1
         / \
        3   2
       / \   \  
      5   3   9 

Output: [1, 3, 9]
```
Solution:
```cpp
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x, TreeNode *left, TreeNode *right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> largestValues(TreeNode* root) {
        
    }
};
```

## 865. Smallest Subtree with all the Deepest Nodes

Given a binary tree rooted at root, the depth of each node is the shortest distance to the root.

A node is deepest if it has the largest depth possible among any node in the entire tree.

The subtree of a node is that node, plus the set of all descendants of that node.

Return the node with the largest depth such that it contains all the deepest nodes in its subtree.

Example 1:

```
Input: [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4]
Output: [2,7,4]
Explanation:

We return the node with value 2, colored in yellow in the diagram.
The nodes colored in blue are the deepest nodes of the tree.
The input "[3, 5, 1, 6, 2, 0, 8, null, null, 7, 4]" is a 
serialization of the given tree.
The output "[2, 7, 4]" is a serialization of the 
subtree rooted at the node with value 2.
Both the input and output have TreeNode type.
```
![](https://s3-lc-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2018/07/01/sketch1.png)

Note:

- The number of nodes in the tree will be between 1 and 500.
- The values of each node are unique.

Solution:
```cpp
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x, TreeNode *left, TreeNode *right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    TreeNode* subtreeWithAllDeepest(TreeNode* root) {
        
    }
};
```

## 582. Kill Process

Given n processes, each process has a unique PID (process id) and its PPID (parent process id).

Each process only has one parent process, but may have one or more children processes. This is just like a tree structure. Only one process has PPID that is 0, which means this process has no parent process. All the PIDs will be distinct positive integers.

We use two list of integers to represent a list of processes, where the first list contains PID for each process and the second list contains the corresponding PPID.

Now given the two lists, and a PID representing a process you want to kill, return a list of PIDs of processes that will be killed in the end. You should assume that when a process is killed, all its children processes will be killed. No order is required for the final answer.

Example 1:
```
Input: 
pid =  [1, 3, 10, 5]
ppid = [3, 0, 5, 3]
kill = 5
Output: [5,10]
Explanation: 
           3
         /   \
        1     5
             /
            10
Kill 5 will also kill 10.
```

Note:

- The given kill id is guaranteed to be one of the given PIDs.
- n >= 1.

Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> killProcess(vector<int>& pid, vector<int>& ppid, int kill) {
        
    }
};
```

### 230. Kth Smallest Element in a BST

Given a binary search tree, write a function kthSmallest to find the kth smallest element in it.

 

Example 1:
```
Input: root = [3,1,4,null,2], k = 1
   3
  / \
 1   4
  \
   2
Output: 1
```
Example 2:
```
Input: root = [5,3,6,2,4,null,null,1], k = 3
       5
      / \
     3   6
    / \
   2   4
  /
 1
Output: 3
```
Follow up:

What if the BST is modified (insert/delete operations) often and you need to find the kth smallest frequently? How would you optimize the kthSmallest routine?

Constraints:

- The number of elements of the BST is between 1 to 10^4.
- You may assume k is always valid, 1 ≤ k ≤ BST's total elements.

Solution:
```cpp
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x, TreeNode *left, TreeNode *right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    int kthSmallest(TreeNode* root, int k) {
        
    }
};
```

## 1245. Tree Diameter

Given an undirected tree, return its diameter: the number of edges in a longest path in that tree.

The tree is given as an array of edges where edges[i] = [u, v] is a bidirectional edge between nodes u and v.  Each node has labels in the set {0, 1, ..., edges.length}.

 

Example 1:

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/06/14/1397_example_1.PNG)

```
Input: edges = [[0,1],[0,2]]
Output: 2
Explanation: 
A longest path of the tree is the path 1 - 0 - 2.
```

Example 2:

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/06/14/1397_example_2.PNG)

```
Input: edges = [[0,1],[1,2],[2,3],[1,4],[4,5]]
Output: 4
Explanation: 
A longest path of the tree is the path 3 - 2 - 1 - 4 - 5.
``` 

Constraints:

- 0 <= edges.length < 10^4
- edges[i][0] != edges[i][1]
- 0 <= edges[i][j] <= edges.length
- The given edges form an undirected tree.

Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int treeDiameter(vector<vector<int>>& edges) {
        
    }
};
```

## 426. Convert Binary Search Tree to Sorted Doubly Linked List
 
Convert a Binary Search Tree to a sorted Circular Doubly-Linked List in place.

You can think of the left and right pointers as synonymous to the predecessor and successor pointers in a doubly-linked list. For a circular doubly linked list, the predecessor of the first element is the last element, and the successor of the last element is the first element.

We want to do the transformation in place. After the transformation, the left pointer of the tree node should point to its predecessor, and the right pointer should point to its successor. You should return the pointer to the smallest element of the linked list.

 

Example 1:

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/10/12/bstdlloriginalbst.png)

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/10/12/bstdllreturndll.png)

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/10/12/bstdllreturnbst.png)

```
Input: root = [4,2,5,1,3]


Output: [1,2,3,4,5]

Explanation: The figure below shows the transformed BST. The solid line indicates 
the successor relationship, while the dashed line means the predecessor relationship.
```

Example 2:
```
Input: root = [2,1,3]
Output: [1,2,3]
```

Example 3:
```
Input: root = []
Output: []
Explanation: Input is an empty tree. Output is also an empty Linked List.
```
Example 4:
```
Input: root = [1]
Output: [1]
```

Constraints:

- -1000 <= Node.val <= 1000
- Node.left.val < Node.val < Node.right.val
- All values of Node.val are unique.
- 0 <= Number of Nodes <= 2000

Solution:
```cpp
/*
// Definition for a Node.
class Node {
public:
    int val;
    Node* left;
    Node* right;

    Node() {}

    Node(int _val) {
        val = _val;
        left = NULL;
        right = NULL;
    }

    Node(int _val, Node* _left, Node* _right) {
        val = _val;
        left = _left;
        right = _right;
    }
};
*/

class Solution {
public:
    Node* treeToDoublyList(Node* root) {
        
    }
};
```

## 1257. Smallest Common Region

You are given some lists of regions where the first region of each list includes all other regions in that list.

Naturally, if a region X contains another region Y then X is bigger than Y. Also by definition a region X contains itself.

Given two regions region1, region2, find out the smallest region that contains both of them.

If you are given regions r1, r2 and r3 such that r1 includes r3, it is guaranteed there is no r2 such that r2 includes r3.

It's guaranteed the smallest region exists.

Example 1:

```
Input:
regions = [["Earth","North America","South America"],
["North America","United States","Canada"],
["United States","New York","Boston"],
["Canada","Ontario","Quebec"],
["South America","Brazil"]],
region1 = "Quebec",
region2 = "New York"
Output: "North America"
```

Constraints:

- 2 <= regions.length <= 10^4
- region1 != region2
- All strings consist of English letters and spaces with at most 20 letters.

Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    string findSmallestRegion(vector<vector<string>>& regions, string region1, string region2) {
        
    }
};
```

## 510. Inorder Successor in BST II

Given a node in a binary search tree, find the in-order successor of that node in the BST.

If that node has no in-order successor, return null.

The successor of a node is the node with the smallest key greater than node.val.

You will have direct access to the node but not to the root of the tree. Each node will have a reference to its parent node. Below is the definition for Node:
```
class Node {
    public int val;
    public Node left;
    public Node right;
    public Node parent;
}
```

Follow up:

Could you solve it without looking up any of the node's values?

Example 1:

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/01/23/285_example_1.PNG)

```
Input: tree = [2,1,3], node = 1
Output: 2
Explanation: 1's in-order successor node is 2. Note that both the node
and the return value is of Node type.
```

Example 2:

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/01/23/285_example_2.PNG)

```
Input: tree = [5,3,6,2,4,null,null,1], node = 6
Output: null
Explanation: There is no in-order successor of the current node, 
so the answer is null.
```

Example 3:

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/02/02/285_example_34.PNG)

```
Input: tree = 
[15,6,18,3,7,17,20,2,4,null,13,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,9], 
node = 15

Output: 17
```

Example 4:

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/02/02/285_example_34.PNG)
```
Input: tree = 
[15,6,18,3,7,17,20,2,4,null,13,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,9], 
node = 13

Output: 15
```
Example 5:
```
Input: tree = [0], node = 0
Output: null
```

Constraints:

- -10^5 <= Node.val <= 10^5
- 1 <= Number of Nodes <= 10^4
- All Nodes will have unique values.

Solution:
```cpp
/*
// Definition for a Node.
class Node {
public:
    int val;
    Node* left;
    Node* right;
    Node* parent;
};
*/

class Solution {
public:
    Node* inorderSuccessor(Node* node) {
        
    }
};
```

## 508. Most Frequent Subtree Sum

Given the root of a tree, you are asked to find the most frequent subtree sum. The subtree sum of a node is defined as the sum of all the node values formed by the subtree rooted at that node (including the node itself). So what is the most frequent subtree sum value? If there is a tie, return all the values with the highest frequency in any order.

Examples 1

Input:
```
  5
 /  \
2   -3
```
return [2, -3, 4], since all the values happen only once, return all of them in any order.

Examples 2

Input:
```
  5
 /  \
2   -5
```

return [2], since 2 happens twice, however -5 only occur once.

Note: You may assume the sum of values in any subtree is in the range of 32-bit signed integer.

Solution:
```cpp
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x, TreeNode *left, TreeNode *right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> findFrequentTreeSum(TreeNode* root) {
        
    }
};
```

## 919. Complete Binary Tree Inserter

A complete binary tree is a binary tree in which every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled, and all nodes are as far left as possible.

Write a data structure CBTInserter that is initialized with a complete binary tree and supports the following operations:

- CBTInserter(TreeNode root) initializes the data structure on a given tree with head node root;
- CBTInserter.insert(int v) will insert a TreeNode into the tree with value node.val = v so that the tree remains complete, and returns the value of the parent of the inserted TreeNode;
- CBTInserter.get_root() will return the head node of the tree.

Example 1:

```
Input: inputs = ["CBTInserter","insert","get_root"], inputs = [[[1]],[2],[]]
Output: [null,1,[1,2]]
```

Example 2:
```
Input: 
inputs = ["CBTInserter","insert","insert","get_root"], 
inputs = [[[1,2,3,4,5,6]],[7],[8],[]]

Output: [null,3,4,[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]]
``` 

Note:

- The initial given tree is complete and contains between 1 and 1000 nodes.
- CBTInserter.insert is called at most 10000 times per test case.
- Every value of a given or inserted node is between 0 and 5000.

Solution:
```cpp
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x, TreeNode *left, TreeNode *right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}
 * };
 */
class CBTInserter {
public:
    CBTInserter(TreeNode* root) {
        
    }
    
    int insert(int v) {
        
    }
    
    TreeNode* get_root() {
        
    }
};

/**
 * Your CBTInserter object will be instantiated and called as such:
 * CBTInserter* obj = new CBTInserter(root);
 * int param_1 = obj->insert(v);
 * TreeNode* param_2 = obj->get_root();
 */
```

## 684. Redundant Connection

In this problem, a tree is an undirected graph that is connected and has no cycles.

The given input is a graph that started as a tree with N nodes (with distinct values 1, 2, ..., N), with one additional edge added. The added edge has two different vertices chosen from 1 to N, and was not an edge that already existed.

The resulting graph is given as a 2D-array of edges. Each element of edges is a pair [u, v] with u < v, that represents an undirected edge connecting nodes u and v.

Return an edge that can be removed so that the resulting graph is a tree of N nodes. If there are multiple answers, return the answer that occurs last in the given 2D-array. The answer edge [u, v] should be in the same format, with u < v.

Example 1:
```
Input: [[1,2], [1,3], [2,3]]
Output: [2,3]
Explanation: The given undirected graph will be like this:
  1
 / \
2 - 3
```
Example 2:
```
Input: [[1,2], [2,3], [3,4], [1,4], [1,5]]
Output: [1,4]
Explanation: The given undirected graph will be like this:
5 - 1 - 2
    |   |
    4 - 3
```
Note:

- The size of the input 2D-array will be between 3 and 1000.
- Every integer represented in the 2D-array will be between 1 and N, where N is the size of the input array.

Update (2017-09-26):
We have overhauled the problem description + test cases and specified clearly the graph is an undirected graph. For the directed graph follow up please see [Redundant Connection II](https://leetcode.com/problems/redundant-connection-ii/description/)). We apologize for any inconvenience caused.

Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> findRedundantConnection(vector<vector<int>>& edges) {
        
    }
};
```

## 173. Binary Search Tree Iterator

Implement an iterator over a binary search tree (BST). Your iterator will be initialized with the root node of a BST.

Calling next() will return the next smallest number in the BST.

Example:

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/25/bst-tree.png)
```
BSTIterator iterator = new BSTIterator(root);
iterator.next();    // return 3
iterator.next();    // return 7
iterator.hasNext(); // return true
iterator.next();    // return 9
iterator.hasNext(); // return true
iterator.next();    // return 15
iterator.hasNext(); // return true
iterator.next();    // return 20
iterator.hasNext(); // return false
```

Note:

- next() and hasNext() should run in average O(1) time and uses O(h) memory, where h is the height of the tree.
- You may assume that next() call will always be valid, that is, there will be at least a next smallest number in the BST when next() is called.

Solution:

```cpp
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x, TreeNode *left, TreeNode *right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}
 * };
 */
class BSTIterator {
public:
    BSTIterator(TreeNode* root) {
        
    }
    
    /** @return the next smallest number */
    int next() {
        
    }
    
    /** @return whether we have a next smallest number */
    bool hasNext() {
        
    }
};

/**
 * Your BSTIterator object will be instantiated and called as such:
 * BSTIterator* obj = new BSTIterator(root);
 * int param_1 = obj->next();
 * bool param_2 = obj->hasNext();
 */
```

## 1443. Minimum Time to Collect All Apples in a Tree

Given an undirected tree consisting of n vertices numbered from 0 to n-1, which has some apples in their vertices. You spend 1 second to walk over one edge of the tree. Return the minimum time in seconds you have to spend in order to collect all apples in the tree starting at vertex 0 and coming back to this vertex.

The edges of the undirected tree are given in the array edges, where edges[i] = [fromi, toi] means that exists an edge connecting the vertices fromi and toi. Additionally, there is a boolean array hasApple, where hasApple[i] = true means that vertex i has an apple, otherwise, it does not have any apple.

```
Input: n = 7, edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,6]], 
hasApple = [false,false,true,false,true,true,false]

Output: 8 
Explanation: The figure above represents the given tree where red vertices have an apple. 
One optimal path to collect all apples is shown by the green arrows.  
```

Example 2:

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/04/23/min_time_collect_apple_2.png)
```
Input: n = 7, 
edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,6]], 
hasApple = [false,false,true,false,false,true,false]

Output: 6

Explanation: The figure above represents the given tree where red vertices have an apple.
One optimal path to collect all apples is shown by the green arrows.  
```

Example 3:
```
Input: n = 7, edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,6]],
hasApple = [false,false,false,false,false,false,false]

Output: 0
```

Constraints:

- 1 <= n <= 10^5
- edges.length == n-1
- edges[i].length == 2
- 0 <= fromi, toi <= n-1
- fromi < toi
- hasApple.length == n

Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minTime(int n, vector<vector<int>>& edges, vector<bool>& hasApple) {
        
    }
};

## 776. Split BST

Given a Binary Search Tree (BST) with root node root, and a target value V, split the tree into two subtrees where one subtree has nodes that are all smaller or equal to the target value, while the other subtree has all nodes that are greater than the target value.  It's not necessarily the case that the tree contains a node with value V.

Additionally, most of the structure of the original tree should remain.  Formally, for any child C with parent P in the original tree, if they are both in the same subtree after the split, then node C should still have the parent P.

You should output the root TreeNode of both subtrees after splitting, in any order.

Example 1:
```
Input: root = [4,2,6,1,3,5,7], V = 2
Output: [[2,1],[4,3,6,null,null,5,7]]
Explanation:
Note that root, output[0], and output[1] are TreeNode objects, not arrays.

The given tree [4,2,6,1,3,5,7] is represented by the following diagram:

          4
        /   \
      2      6
     / \    / \
    1   3  5   7

while the diagrams for the outputs are:

          4
        /   \
      3      6      and    2
            / \           /
           5   7         1
```

Note:

- The size of the BST will not exceed 50.
- The BST is always valid and each node's value is different.

Solution:
```cpp
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x, TreeNode *left, TreeNode *right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    vector<TreeNode*> splitBST(TreeNode* root, int V) {
        
    }
};
```

## 144. Binary Tree Preorder Traversal

Given a binary tree, return the preorder traversal of its nodes' values.

Example:
```
Input: [1,null,2,3]
   1
    \
     2
    /
   3

Output: [1,2,3]
```
Follow up: Recursive solution is trivial, could you do it iteratively?

Solution:
```cpp
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x, TreeNode *left, TreeNode *right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> preorderTraversal(TreeNode* root) {
        
    }
};
```

## 156. Binary Tree Upside Down

Given a binary tree where all the right nodes are either leaf nodes with a sibling (a left node that shares the same parent node) or empty, flip it upside down and turn it into a tree where the original right nodes turned into left leaf nodes. Return the new root.

Example:
```
Input: [1,2,3,4,5]

    1
   / \
  2   3
 / \
4   5

Output: return the root of the binary tree [4,5,2,#,#,3,1]

   4
  / \
 5   2
    / \
   3   1  
```

Clarification:

Confused what [4,5,2,#,#,3,1] means? Read more below on how binary tree is serialized on OJ.

The serialization of a binary tree follows a level order traversal, where '#' signifies a path terminator where no node exists below.

Here's an example:
```
   1
  / \
 2   3
    /
   4
    \
     5
```
The above binary tree is serialized as [1,2,3,#,#,4,#,#,5].

Solution:
```cpp
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x, TreeNode *left, TreeNode *right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    TreeNode* upsideDownBinaryTree(TreeNode* root) {
        
    }
};
```

## 655. Print Binary Tree

Print a binary tree in an m*n 2D string array following these rules:

- The row number m should be equal to the height of the given binary tree.
- The column number n should always be an odd number.
- The root node's value (in string format) should be put in the exactly middle of the first row it can be put. The column and the row where the root node belongs will separate the rest space into two parts (left-bottom part and right-bottom part). You should print the left subtree in the left-bottom part and print the right subtree in the right-bottom part. The left-bottom part and the right-bottom part should have the same size. Even if one subtree is none while the other is not, you don't need to print anything for the none subtree but still need to leave the space as large as that for the other subtree. However, if two subtrees are none, then you don't need to leave space for both of them.
- Each unused space should contain an empty string "".
- Print the subtrees following the same rules.

Example 1:
```
Input:
     1
    /
   2
Output:
[["", "1", ""],
 ["2", "", ""]]
```
Example 2:
```
Input:
     1
    / \
   2   3
    \
     4
Output:
[["", "", "", "1", "", "", ""],
 ["", "2", "", "", "", "3", ""],
 ["", "", "4", "", "", "", ""]]
```

Example 3:
```
Input:
      1
     / \
    2   5
   / 
  3 
 / 
4 
Output:

[["",  "",  "", "",  "", "", "", "1", "",  "",  "",  "",  "", "", ""]
 ["",  "",  "", "2", "", "", "", "",  "",  "",  "",  "5", "", "", ""]
 ["",  "3", "", "",  "", "", "", "",  "",  "",  "",  "",  "", "", ""]
 ["4", "",  "", "",  "", "", "", "",  "",  "",  "",  "",  "", "", ""]]
```

Note: The height of binary tree is in the range of [1, 10].

Solution:
```cpp
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x, TreeNode *left, TreeNode *right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<string>> printTree(TreeNode* root) {
        
    }
};
```

## 863. All Nodes Distance K in Binary Tree

We are given a binary tree (with root node root), a target node, and an integer value K.

Return a list of the values of all nodes that have a distance K from the target node.  The answer can be returned in any order.

Example 1:

```
Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], target = 5, K = 2

Output: [7,4,1]

Explanation: 
The nodes that are a distance 2 from the target node (with value 5)
have values 7, 4, and 1.

Note that the inputs "root" and "target" are actually TreeNodes.
The descriptions of the inputs above are just serializations of these objects.
```

![](https://s3-lc-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2018/06/28/sketch0.png)

Note:

- The given tree is non-empty.
- Each node in the tree has unique values 0 <= node.val <= 500.
- The target node is a node in the tree.
- 0 <= K <= 1000.

Solution:
```cpp
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(NULL), right(NULL) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> distanceK(TreeNode* root, TreeNode* target, int K) {
        
    }
};
```

## 666. Path Sum IV

If the depth of a tree is smaller than 5, then this tree can be represented by a list of three-digits integers.

For each integer in this list:

- The hundreds digit represents the depth D of this node, 1 <= D <= 4.
- The tens digit represents the position P of this node in the level it belongs to, 1 <= P <= 8. The position is the same as that in a full binary tree.
- The units digit represents the value V of this node, 0 <= V <= 9.

Given a list of ascending three-digits integers representing a binary tree with the depth smaller than 5, you need to return the sum of all paths from the root towards the leaves.

It's guaranteed that the given list represents a valid connected binary tree.

Example 1:
```
Input: [113, 215, 221]
Output: 12
Explanation: 
The tree that the list represents is:
    3
   / \
  5   1

The path sum is (3 + 5) + (3 + 1) = 12.
```

Example 2:
```
Input: [113, 221]
Output: 4
Explanation: 
The tree that the list represents is: 
    3
     \
      1

The path sum is (3 + 1) = 4.
```

Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int pathSum(vector<int>& nums) {
        
    }
};
```

## 102. Binary Tree Level Order Traversal

Given a binary tree, return the level order traversal of its nodes' values. (ie, from left to right, level by level).

For example:
Given binary tree [3,9,20,null,null,15,7],
```
    3
   / \
  9  20
    /  \
   15   7
```
return its level order traversal as:
```
[
  [3],
  [9,20],
  [15,7]
]
```

Solution:
```cpp
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x, TreeNode *left, TreeNode *right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<int>> levelOrder(TreeNode* root) {
        
    }
};
```

## 199. Binary Tree Right Side View

Given a binary tree, imagine yourself standing on the right side of it, return the values of the nodes you can see ordered from top to bottom.

Example:
```
Input: [1,2,3,null,5,null,4]
Output: [1, 3, 4]
Explanation:

   1            <---
 /   \
2     3         <---
 \     \
  5     4       <---
```

Solution:

```cpp
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x, TreeNode *left, TreeNode *right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> rightSideView(TreeNode* root) {
        
    }
};
```

## 1372. Longest ZigZag Path in a Binary Tree

Given a binary tree root, a ZigZag path for a binary tree is defined as follow:

- Choose any node in the binary tree and a direction (right or left).
- If the current direction is right then move to the right child of the current node otherwise move to the left child.
- Change the direction from right to left or right to left.
- Repeat the second and third step until you can't move in the tree.
- Zigzag length is defined as the number of nodes visited - 1. (A single node has a length of 0).

Return the longest ZigZag path contained in that tree.

Example 1:

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/01/22/sample_1_1702.png)

```
Input: root = [1,null,1,1,1,null,null,1,1,null,1,null,null,null,1,null,1]
Output: 3
Explanation: Longest ZigZag path in blue nodes (right -> left -> right).
```

Example 2:

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/01/22/sample_2_1702.png)

```
Input: root = [1,1,1,null,1,null,null,1,1,null,1]
Output: 4
Explanation: Longest ZigZag path in blue nodes (left -> right -> left -> right).
```

Example 3:
```
Input: root = [1]
Output: 0
```

Constraints:

- Each tree has at most 50000 nodes..
- Each node's value is between [1, 100].

Solution:
```cpp
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x, TreeNode *left, TreeNode *right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    int longestZigZag(TreeNode* root) {
        
    }
};
```

## 96. Unique Binary Search Trees

Given n, how many structurally unique BST's (binary search trees) that store values 1 ... n?

Example:
```
Input: 3
Output: 5
Explanation:
Given n = 3, there are a total of 5 unique BST's:

   1         3     3      2      1
    \       /     /      / \      \
     3     2     1      1   3      2
    /     /       \                 \
   2     1         2                 3
```

Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int numTrees(int n) {
        
    }
};
```

## 958. Check Completeness of a Binary Tree

Given a binary tree, determine if it is a complete binary tree.

Definition of a complete binary tree from [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_tree#Types_of_binary_trees):

In a complete binary tree every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled, and all nodes in the last level are as far left as possible. It can have between 1 and 2h nodes inclusive at the last level h.

 

Example 1:

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/15/complete-binary-tree-1.png)
```
Input: [1,2,3,4,5,6]
Output: true
Explanation: Every level before the last is full (ie. levels with node-values {1} and {2, 3}), 
and all nodes in the last level ({4, 5, 6}) are as far left as possible.
```
Example 2:

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/15/complete-binary-tree-2.png)
```
Input: [1,2,3,4,5,null,7]
Output: false
Explanation: The node with value 7 isn't as far left as possible.
```

Note:

- The tree will have between 1 and 100 nodes.

Solution:
```cpp
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x, TreeNode *left, TreeNode *right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    bool isCompleteTree(TreeNode* root) {
        
    }
};
```

## 250. Count Univalue Subtrees
 
Given a binary tree, count the number of uni-value subtrees.

A Uni-value subtree means all nodes of the subtree have the same value.

Example :
```
Input:  root = [5,1,5,5,5,null,5]

              5
             / \
            1   5
           / \   \
          5   5   5

Output: 4
```

Solution:
```cpp
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x, TreeNode *left, TreeNode *right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    int countUnivalSubtrees(TreeNode* root) {
        
    }
};
```

## 449. Serialize and Deserialize BST

Serialization is the process of converting a data structure or object into a sequence of bits so that it can be stored in a file or memory buffer, or transmitted across a network connection link to be reconstructed later in the same or another computer environment.

Design an algorithm to serialize and deserialize a binary search tree. There is no restriction on how your serialization/deserialization algorithm should work. You just need to ensure that a binary search tree can be serialized to a string and this string can be deserialized to the original tree structure.

The encoded string should be as compact as possible.

Note: Do not use class member/global/static variables to store states. Your serialize and deserialize algorithms should be stateless.

Solution:
```cpp
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(NULL), right(NULL) {}
 * };
 */
class Codec {
public:

    // Encodes a tree to a single string.
    string serialize(TreeNode* root) {
        
    }

    // Decodes your encoded data to tree.
    TreeNode* deserialize(string data) {
        
    }
};

// Your Codec object will be instantiated and called as such:
// Codec codec;
// codec.deserialize(codec.serialize(root));
```

## 1145. Binary Tree Coloring Game

Two players play a turn based game on a binary tree.  We are given the root of this binary tree, and the number of nodes n in the tree.  n is odd, and each node has a distinct value from 1 to n.

Initially, the first player names a value x with 1 <= x <= n, and the second player names a value y with 1 <= y <= n and y != x.  The first player colors the node with value x red, and the second player colors the node with value y blue.

Then, the players take turns starting with the first player.  In each turn, that player chooses a node of their color (red if player 1, blue if player 2) and colors an uncolored neighbor of the chosen node (either the left child, right child, or parent of the chosen node.)

If (and only if) a player cannot choose such a node in this way, they must pass their turn.  If both players pass their turn, the game ends, and the winner is the player that colored more nodes.

You are the second player.  If it is possible to choose such a y to ensure you win the game, return true.  If it is not possible, return false.


Example 1:

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/08/01/1480-binary-tree-coloring-game.png)

Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11], n = 11, x = 3
Output: true
Explanation: The second player can choose the node with value 2.

Constraints:

- root is the root of a binary tree with n nodes and distinct node values from 1 to n.
- n is odd.
- 1 <= x <= n <= 100

Solution:
```cpp
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x, TreeNode *left, TreeNode *right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    bool btreeGameWinningMove(TreeNode* root, int n, int x) {
        
    }
};
```

## 337. House Robber III

The thief has found himself a new place for his thievery again. There is only one entrance to this area, called the "root." Besides the root, each house has one and only one parent house. After a tour, the smart thief realized that "all houses in this place forms a binary tree". It will automatically contact the police if two directly-linked houses were broken into on the same night.

Determine the maximum amount of money the thief can rob tonight without alerting the police.

Example 1:
```
Input: [3,2,3,null,3,null,1]

     3
    / \
   2   3
    \   \ 
     3   1

Output: 7 
Explanation: Maximum amount of money the thief can rob = 3 + 3 + 1 = 7.
```

Example 2:

```
Input: [3,4,5,1,3,null,1]

     3
    / \
   4   5
  / \   \ 
 1   3   1

Output: 9
Explanation: Maximum amount of money the thief can rob = 4 + 5 = 9.
```

Solution:
```cpp
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x, TreeNode *left, TreeNode *right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    int rob(TreeNode* root) {
        
    }
};
```

## 652. Find Duplicate Subtrees

Given a binary tree, return all duplicate subtrees. For each kind of duplicate subtrees, you only need to return the root node of any one of them.

Two trees are duplicate if they have the same structure with same node values.

Example 1:
```
        1
       / \
      2   3
     /   / \
    4   2   4
       /
      4
```
The following are two duplicate subtrees:
```
      2
     /
    4
```
and
```
    4
```
Therefore, you need to return above trees' root in the form of a list.

Solution:
```cpp
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x, TreeNode *left, TreeNode *right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    vector<TreeNode*> findDuplicateSubtrees(TreeNode* root) {
        
    }
};
```

## 623. Add One Row to Tree

Given the root of a binary tree, then value v and depth d, you need to add a row of nodes with value v at the given depth d. The root node is at depth 1.

The adding rule is: given a positive integer depth d, for each NOT null tree nodes N in depth d-1, create two tree nodes with value v as N's left subtree root and right subtree root. And N's original left subtree should be the left subtree of the new left subtree root, its original right subtree should be the right subtree of the new right subtree root. If depth d is 1 that means there is no depth d-1 at all, then create a tree node with value v as the new root of the whole original tree, and the original tree is the new root's left subtree.

Example 1:
```
Input: 
A binary tree as following:
       4
     /   \
    2     6
   / \   / 
  3   1 5   

v = 1

d = 2

Output: 
       4
      / \
     1   1
    /     \
   2       6
  / \     / 
 3   1   5   
```

Example 2:
```
Input: 
A binary tree as following:
      4
     /   
    2    
   / \   
  3   1    

v = 1

d = 3

Output: 
      4
     /   
    2
   / \    
  1   1
 /     \  
3       1
```

Note:
- The given d is in range [1, maximum depth of the given tree + 1].
- The given binary tree has at least one tree node.

Solution:
```cpp
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x, TreeNode *left, TreeNode *right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    TreeNode* addOneRow(TreeNode* root, int v, int d) {
        
    }
};
```

## 114. Flatten Binary Tree to Linked List

Given a binary tree, flatten it to a linked list in-place.

For example, given the following tree:
```
    1
   / \
  2   5
 / \   \
3   4   6
```

The flattened tree should look like:

```
1
 \
  2
   \
    3
     \
      4
       \
        5
         \
          6
```

Solution:
```cpp
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x, TreeNode *left, TreeNode *right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    void flatten(TreeNode* root) {
        
    }
};
```

## 129. Sum Root to Leaf Numbers

Given a binary tree containing digits from 0-9 only, each root-to-leaf path could represent a number.

An example is the root-to-leaf path 1->2->3 which represents the number 123.

Find the total sum of all root-to-leaf numbers.

Note: A leaf is a node with no children.

Example:
```
Input: [1,2,3]
    1
   / \
  2   3
Output: 25
Explanation:
The root-to-leaf path 1->2 represents the number 12.
The root-to-leaf path 1->3 represents the number 13.
Therefore, sum = 12 + 13 = 25.
```

Example 2:
```
Input: [4,9,0,5,1]
    4
   / \
  9   0
 / \
5   1
Output: 1026
Explanation:
The root-to-leaf path 4->9->5 represents the number 495.
The root-to-leaf path 4->9->1 represents the number 491.
The root-to-leaf path 4->0 represents the number 40.
Therefore, sum = 495 + 491 + 40 = 1026.
```

Solution:
```cpp
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x, TreeNode *left, TreeNode *right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    int sumNumbers(TreeNode* root) {
        
    }
};
```

## 105. Construct Binary Tree from Preorder and Inorder Traversal
 
Given preorder and inorder traversal of a tree, construct the binary tree.

Note:
You may assume that duplicates do not exist in the tree.

For example, given
```
preorder = [3,9,20,15,7]
inorder = [9,3,15,20,7]
```

Return the following binary tree:

```
    3
   / \
  9  20
    /  \
   15   7
```

Solution:
```cpp
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x, TreeNode *left, TreeNode *right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    TreeNode* buildTree(vector<int>& preorder, vector<int>& inorder) {
        
    }
};
```

## 536. Construct Binary Tree from String

You need to construct a binary tree from a string consisting of parenthesis and integers.

The whole input represents a binary tree. It contains an integer followed by zero, one or two pairs of parenthesis. The integer represents the root's value and a pair of parenthesis contains a child binary tree with the same structure.

You always start to construct the left child node of the parent first if it exists.

Example:
```
Input: "4(2(3)(1))(6(5))"
Output: return the tree root node representing the following tree:

       4
     /   \
    2     6
   / \   / 
  3   1 5   
```

Note:
- There will only be '(', ')', '-' and '0' ~ '9' in the input string.
- An empty tree is represented by "" instead of "()".

Solution:
```cpp
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x, TreeNode *left, TreeNode *right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    TreeNode* str2tree(string s) {
        
    }
};
```

## 103. Binary Tree Zigzag Level Order Traversal

Given a binary tree, return the zigzag level order traversal of its nodes' values. (ie, from left to right, then right to left for the next level and alternate between).

For example:
Given binary tree [3,9,20,null,null,15,7],
```
    3
   / \
  9  20
    /  \
   15   7
```
return its zigzag level order traversal as:
```
[
  [3],
  [20,9],
  [15,7]
]
```

Solution:
```cpp
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x, TreeNode *left, TreeNode *right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<int>> zigzagLevelOrder(TreeNode* root) {
        
    }
};
```

## 298. Binary Tree Longest Consecutive Sequence

Given a binary tree, find the length of the longest consecutive sequence path.

The path refers to any sequence of nodes from some starting node to any node in the tree along the parent-child connections. The longest consecutive path need to be from parent to child (cannot be the reverse).

Example 1:
```
Input:

   1
    \
     3
    / \
   2   4
        \
         5

Output: 3

Explanation: Longest consecutive sequence path is 3-4-5, so return 3.
```

Example 2:
```
Input:

   2
    \
     3
    / 
   2    
  / 
 1

Output: 2 

Explanation: Longest consecutive sequence path is 2-3, not 3-2-1, so return 2.
```

```cpp
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x, TreeNode *left, TreeNode *right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    int longestConsecutive(TreeNode* root) {
        
    }
};
```

## 549. Binary Tree Longest Consecutive Sequence II

Given a binary tree, you need to find the length of Longest Consecutive Path in Binary Tree.

Especially, this path can be either increasing or decreasing. For example, [1,2,3,4] and [4,3,2,1] are both considered valid, but the path [1,2,4,3] is not valid. On the other hand, the path can be in the child-Parent-child order, where not necessarily be parent-child order.

Example 1:
```
Input:
        1
       / \
      2   3
Output: 2
Explanation: The longest consecutive path is [1, 2] or [2, 1].
```

Example 2:
```
Input:
        2
       / \
      1   3
Output: 3
Explanation: The longest consecutive path is [1, 2, 3] or [3, 2, 1].
```

Note: All the values of tree nodes are in the range of [-1e7, 1e7].

Solution:
```cpp
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x, TreeNode *left, TreeNode *right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    int longestConsecutive(TreeNode* root) {
        
    }
};
```

## 113. Path Sum II

Given a binary tree and a sum, find all root-to-leaf paths where each path's sum equals the given sum.

Note: A leaf is a node with no children.

Example:

Given the below binary tree and sum = 22,
```
      5
     / \
    4   8
   /   / \
  11  13  4
 /  \    / \
7    2  5   1
```
Return:
```
[
   [5,4,11,2],
   [5,8,4,5]
]
```

Solution:
```cpp
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x, TreeNode *left, TreeNode *right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<int>> pathSum(TreeNode* root, int sum) {
        
    }
};
```

## 222. Count Complete Tree Nodes

Given a complete binary tree, count the number of nodes.

Note:

Definition of a complete binary tree from Wikipedia:
In a complete binary tree every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled, and all nodes in the last level are as far left as possible. It can have between 1 and 2h nodes inclusive at the last level h.

Example:
```
Input: 
    1
   / \
  2   3
 / \  /
4  5 6

Output: 6
```

Solution:
```cpp
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x, TreeNode *left, TreeNode *right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    int countNodes(TreeNode* root) {
        
    }
};
```

## 988. Smallest String Starting From Leaf

Given the root of a binary tree, each node has a value from 0 to 25 representing the letters 'a' to 'z': a value of 0 represents 'a', a value of 1 represents 'b', and so on.

Find the lexicographically smallest string that starts at a leaf of this tree and ends at the root.

(As a reminder, any shorter prefix of a string is lexicographically smaller: for example, "ab" is lexicographically smaller than "aba".  A leaf of a node is a node that has no children.)

 

Example 1:

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/01/30/tree1.png)

```
Input: [0,1,2,3,4,3,4]
Output: "dba"
```

Example 2:

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/01/30/tree2.png)

```
Input: [25,1,3,1,3,0,2]
Output: "adz"
```

Example 3:

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/02/01/tree3.png)
```
Input: [2,2,1,null,1,0,null,0]
Output: "abc"
```

Note:

- The number of nodes in the given tree will be between 1 and 8500.
- Each node in the tree will have a value between 0 and 25.

Solution:
```cpp
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x, TreeNode *left, TreeNode *right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    string smallestFromLeaf(TreeNode* root) {
        
    }
};
```
