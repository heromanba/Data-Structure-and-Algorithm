## 621. Task Scheduler
 
You are given a char array representing tasks CPU need to do. It contains capital letters A to Z where each letter represents a different task. Tasks could be done without the original order of the array. Each task is done in one unit of time. For each unit of time, the CPU could complete either one task or just be idle.

However, there is a non-negative integer n that represents the cooldown period between two same tasks (the same letter in the array), that is that there must be at least n units of time between any two same tasks.

You need to return the least number of units of times that the CPU will take to finish all the given tasks.

Example 1:
```
Input: tasks = ["A","A","A","B","B","B"], n = 2
Output: 8
Explanation: 
A -> B -> idle -> A -> B -> idle -> A -> B
There is at least 2 units of time between any two same tasks.
```
Example 2:
```
Input: tasks = ["A","A","A","B","B","B"], n = 0
Output: 6
Explanation: On this case any permutation of size 6 would work since n = 0.
["A","A","A","B","B","B"]
["A","B","A","B","A","B"]
["B","B","B","A","A","A"]
...
And so on.
```
Example 3:
```
Input: tasks = ["A","A","A","A","A","A","B","C","D","E","F","G"], n = 2
Output: 16
Explanation: 
One possible solution is
A -> B -> C -> A -> D -> E -> A -> F -> G -> A -> idle -> idle -> A -> idle -> idle -> A
```

Constraints:

- The number of tasks is in the range [1, 10000].
- The integer n is in the range [0, 100].

Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int leastInterval(vector<char>& tasks, int n) {
        
    }
};
```

## 363. Max Sum of Rectangle No Larger Than K

Given a non-empty 2D matrix matrix and an integer k, find the max sum of a rectangle in the matrix such that its sum is no larger than k.

Example:
```
Input: matrix = [[1,0,1],[0,-2,3]], k = 2
Output: 2 
Explanation: Because the sum of rectangle [[0, 1], [-2, 3]] is 2,
             and 2 is the max number no larger than k (k = 2).
```

Note:

- The rectangle inside the matrix must have an area > 0.
- What if the number of rows is much larger than the number of columns?

Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxSumSubmatrix(vector<vector<int>>& matrix, int k) {
        
    }
};
```

## 346. Moving Average from Data Stream

Given a stream of integers and a window size, calculate the moving average of all integers in the sliding window.

Example:
```
MovingAverage m = new MovingAverage(3);
m.next(1) = 1
m.next(10) = (1 + 10) / 2
m.next(3) = (1 + 10 + 3) / 3
m.next(5) = (10 + 3 + 5) / 3
```

Solution:

```cpp
class MovingAverage {
public:
    /** Initialize your data structure here. */
    MovingAverage(int size) {
        
    }
    
    double next(int val) {
        
    }
};

/**
 * Your MovingAverage object will be instantiated and called as such:
 * MovingAverage* obj = new MovingAverage(size);
 * double param_1 = obj->next(val);
 */
```

## 933. Number of Recent Calls

Write a class RecentCounter to count recent requests.

It has only one method: ping(int t), where t represents some time in milliseconds.

Return the number of pings that have been made from 3000 milliseconds ago until now.

Any ping with time in [t - 3000, t] will count, including the current ping.

It is guaranteed that every call to ping uses a strictly larger value of t than before.

 

Example 1:
```
Input: inputs = ["RecentCounter","ping","ping","ping","ping"], inputs = [[],[1],[100],[3001],[3002]]
Output: [null,1,2,3,3]
```

Note:

- Each test case will have at most 10000 calls to ping.
- Each test case will call ping with strictly increasing values of t.
- Each call to ping will have 1 <= t <= 10^9.

Solution:
```cpp
class RecentCounter {
public:
    RecentCounter() {
        
    }
    
    int ping(int t) {
        
    }
};

/**
 * Your RecentCounter object will be instantiated and called as such:
 * RecentCounter* obj = new RecentCounter();
 * int param_1 = obj->ping(t);
 */
```

## 862. Shortest Subarray with Sum at Least K

Return the length of the shortest, non-empty, contiguous subarray of A with sum at least K.

If there is no non-empty subarray with sum at least K, return -1.

Example 1:
```
Input: A = [1], K = 1
Output: 1
```
Example 2:
```
Input: A = [1,2], K = 4
Output: -1
```
Example 3:
```
Input: A = [2,-1,2], K = 3
Output: 3
```

Note:

- 1 <= A.length <= 50000
- -10 ^ 5 <= A[i] <= 10 ^ 5
- 1 <= K <= 10 ^ 9

Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int shortestSubarray(vector<int>& A, int K) {
        
    }
};
```
