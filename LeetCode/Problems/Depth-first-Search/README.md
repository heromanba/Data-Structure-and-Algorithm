## 200. Number of Islands

Given a 2d grid map of '1's (land) and '0's (water), count the number of islands. An island is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water. 

Example 1:
```
Input: grid = [
  ["1","1","1","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["0","0","0","0","0"]
]
Output: 1
```
Example 2:

```
Input: grid = [
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["0","0","1","0","0"],
  ["0","0","0","1","1"]
]
Output: 3
```
Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int numIslands(vector<vector<char>>& grid) {
        
    }
};
```

## 104. Maximum Depth of Binary Tree

Given a binary tree, find its maximum depth.

The maximum depth is the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.

Note: A leaf is a node with no children.

Example:

Given binary tree [3,9,20,null,null,15,7],
```
    3
   / \
  9  20
    /  \
   15   7
```   
return its depth = 3.

Solution:
```cpp
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x, TreeNode *left, TreeNode *right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    int maxDepth(TreeNode* root) {
        
    }
};
```

## 1192. Critical Connections in a Network

There are n servers numbered from 0 to n-1 connected by undirected server-to-server connections forming a network where connections[i] = [a, b] represents a connection between servers a and b. Any server can reach any other server directly or indirectly through the network.

A critical connection is a connection that, if removed, will make some server unable to reach some other server.

Return all critical connections in the network in any order.

Example 1:

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/09/03/1537_ex1_2.png)
```
Input: n = 4, connections = [[0,1],[1,2],[2,0],[1,3]]
Output: [[1,3]]
Explanation: [[3,1]] is also accepted.
```

Constraints:

- 1 <= n <= 10^5
- n-1 <= connections.length <= 10^5
- connections[i][0] != connections[i][1]
- There are no repeated connections.

Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<int>> criticalConnections(int n, vector<vector<int>>& connections) {
        
    }
};
```

## 108. Convert Sorted Array to Binary Search Tree

Given an array where elements are sorted in ascending order, convert it to a height balanced BST.

For this problem, a height-balanced binary tree is defined as a binary tree in which the depth of the two subtrees of every node never differ by more than 1.

Example:
```
Given the sorted array: [-10,-3,0,5,9],

One possible answer is: [0,-3,9,-10,null,5], which represents the following height balanced BST:

      0
     / \
   -3   9
   /   /
 -10  5
```

Solution:
```cpp
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x, TreeNode *left, TreeNode *right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    TreeNode* sortedArrayToBST(vector<int>& nums) {
        
    }
};
```

## 394. Decode String

Given an encoded string, return its decoded string.

The encoding rule is: k[encoded_string], where the encoded_string inside the square brackets is being repeated exactly k times. Note that k is guaranteed to be a positive integer.

You may assume that the input string is always valid; No extra white spaces, square brackets are well-formed, etc.

Furthermore, you may assume that the original data does not contain any digits and that digits are only for those repeat numbers, k. For example, there won't be input like 3a or 2[4]. 

Example 1:
```
Input: s = "3[a]2[bc]"
Output: "aaabcbc"
```
Example 2:
```
Input: s = "3[a2[c]]"
Output: "accaccacc"
```
Example 3:
```
Input: s = "2[abc]3[cd]ef"
Output: "abcabccdcdcdef"
```
Example 4:
```
Input: s = "abc3[cd]xyz"
Output: "abccdcdcdxyz"
```

Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    string decodeString(string s) {
        
    }
};
```

## 301. Remove Invalid Parentheses

Remove the minimum number of invalid parentheses in order to make the input string valid. Return all possible results.

Note: The input string may contain letters other than the parentheses ( and ).

Example 1:
```
Input: "()())()"
Output: ["()()()", "(())()"]
```
Example 2:

```
Input: "(a)())()"
Output: ["(a)()()", "(a())()"]
```
Example 3:

```
Input: ")("
Output: [""]
```

Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<string> removeInvalidParentheses(string s) {
        
    }
};
```

## 105. Construct Binary Tree from Preorder and Inorder Traversal

Given preorder and inorder traversal of a tree, construct the binary tree.

Note:
You may assume that duplicates do not exist in the tree.

For example, given
```
preorder = [3,9,20,15,7]
inorder = [9,3,15,20,7]
```
Return the following binary tree:
```
    3
   / \
  9  20
    /  \
   15   7
```

Solution:
```cpp
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x, TreeNode *left, TreeNode *right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    TreeNode* buildTree(vector<int>& preorder, vector<int>& inorder) {
        
    }
};
```

## 100. Same Tree

Given two binary trees, write a function to check if they are the same or not.

Two binary trees are considered the same if they are structurally identical and the nodes have the same value.

Example 1:
```
Input:     1         1
          / \       / \
         2   3     2   3

        [1,2,3],   [1,2,3]

Output: true
```
Example 2:

```
Input:     1         1
          /           \
         2             2

        [1,2],     [1,null,2]

Output: false
```
Example 3:

```
Input:     1         1
          / \       / \
         2   1     1   2

        [1,2,1],   [1,1,2]

Output: false
```

Solution:

```cpp
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x, TreeNode *left, TreeNode *right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    bool isSameTree(TreeNode* p, TreeNode* q) {
        
    }
};
```

## 979. Distribute Coins in Binary Tree

Given the root of a binary tree with N nodes, each node in the tree has node.val coins, and there are N coins total.

In one move, we may choose two adjacent nodes and move one coin from one node to another.  (The move may be from parent to child, or from child to parent.)

Return the number of moves required to make every node have exactly one coin.

 

Example 1:

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/01/18/tree1.png)
```
Input: [3,0,0]
Output: 2
Explanation: From the root of the tree, we move one coin to its left child, 
and one coin to its right child.
```

Example 2:

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/01/18/tree2.png)

```
Input: [0,3,0]
Output: 3
Explanation: From the left child of the root, we move two coins to the root 
[taking two moves].  Then, we move one coin from the root of the tree to the 
right child.
```
Example 3:

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/01/18/tree3.png)

```
Input: [1,0,2]
Output: 2
```
Example 4:

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/01/18/tree4.png)

```
Input: [1,0,0,null,3]
Output: 4
```
 

Note:

- 1<= N <= 100
- 0 <= node.val <= N
