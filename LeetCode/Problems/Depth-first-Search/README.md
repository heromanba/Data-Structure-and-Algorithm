## 200. Number of Islands

Given a 2d grid map of '1's (land) and '0's (water), count the number of islands. An island is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water. 

Example 1:
```
Input: grid = [
  ["1","1","1","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["0","0","0","0","0"]
]
Output: 1
```
Example 2:

```
Input: grid = [
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["0","0","1","0","0"],
  ["0","0","0","1","1"]
]
Output: 3
```
Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int numIslands(vector<vector<char>>& grid) {
        
    }
};
```

## 104. Maximum Depth of Binary Tree

Given a binary tree, find its maximum depth.

The maximum depth is the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.

Note: A leaf is a node with no children.

Example:

Given binary tree [3,9,20,null,null,15,7],
```
    3
   / \
  9  20
    /  \
   15   7
```   
return its depth = 3.

Solution:
```cpp
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x, TreeNode *left, TreeNode *right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    int maxDepth(TreeNode* root) {
        
    }
};
```

## 1192. Critical Connections in a Network

There are n servers numbered from 0 to n-1 connected by undirected server-to-server connections forming a network where connections[i] = [a, b] represents a connection between servers a and b. Any server can reach any other server directly or indirectly through the network.

A critical connection is a connection that, if removed, will make some server unable to reach some other server.

Return all critical connections in the network in any order.

Example 1:

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/09/03/1537_ex1_2.png)
```
Input: n = 4, connections = [[0,1],[1,2],[2,0],[1,3]]
Output: [[1,3]]
Explanation: [[3,1]] is also accepted.
```

Constraints:

- 1 <= n <= 10^5
- n-1 <= connections.length <= 10^5
- connections[i][0] != connections[i][1]
- There are no repeated connections.

Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<int>> criticalConnections(int n, vector<vector<int>>& connections) {
        
    }
};
```

## 108. Convert Sorted Array to Binary Search Tree

Given an array where elements are sorted in ascending order, convert it to a height balanced BST.

For this problem, a height-balanced binary tree is defined as a binary tree in which the depth of the two subtrees of every node never differ by more than 1.

Example:
```
Given the sorted array: [-10,-3,0,5,9],

One possible answer is: [0,-3,9,-10,null,5], which represents the following height balanced BST:

      0
     / \
   -3   9
   /   /
 -10  5
```

Solution:
```cpp
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x, TreeNode *left, TreeNode *right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    TreeNode* sortedArrayToBST(vector<int>& nums) {
        
    }
};
```

## 394. Decode String

Given an encoded string, return its decoded string.

The encoding rule is: k[encoded_string], where the encoded_string inside the square brackets is being repeated exactly k times. Note that k is guaranteed to be a positive integer.

You may assume that the input string is always valid; No extra white spaces, square brackets are well-formed, etc.

Furthermore, you may assume that the original data does not contain any digits and that digits are only for those repeat numbers, k. For example, there won't be input like 3a or 2[4]. 

Example 1:
```
Input: s = "3[a]2[bc]"
Output: "aaabcbc"
```
Example 2:
```
Input: s = "3[a2[c]]"
Output: "accaccacc"
```
Example 3:
```
Input: s = "2[abc]3[cd]ef"
Output: "abcabccdcdcdef"
```
Example 4:
```
Input: s = "abc3[cd]xyz"
Output: "abccdcdcdxyz"
```

Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    string decodeString(string s) {
        
    }
};
```

## 301. Remove Invalid Parentheses

Remove the minimum number of invalid parentheses in order to make the input string valid. Return all possible results.

Note: The input string may contain letters other than the parentheses ( and ).

Example 1:
```
Input: "()())()"
Output: ["()()()", "(())()"]
```
Example 2:

```
Input: "(a)())()"
Output: ["(a)()()", "(a())()"]
```
Example 3:

```
Input: ")("
Output: [""]
```

Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<string> removeInvalidParentheses(string s) {
        
    }
};
```

## 105. Construct Binary Tree from Preorder and Inorder Traversal

Given preorder and inorder traversal of a tree, construct the binary tree.

Note:
You may assume that duplicates do not exist in the tree.

For example, given
```
preorder = [3,9,20,15,7]
inorder = [9,3,15,20,7]
```
Return the following binary tree:
```
    3
   / \
  9  20
    /  \
   15   7
```

Solution:
```cpp
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x, TreeNode *left, TreeNode *right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    TreeNode* buildTree(vector<int>& preorder, vector<int>& inorder) {
        
    }
};
```

## 100. Same Tree

Given two binary trees, write a function to check if they are the same or not.

Two binary trees are considered the same if they are structurally identical and the nodes have the same value.

Example 1:
```
Input:     1         1
          / \       / \
         2   3     2   3

        [1,2,3],   [1,2,3]

Output: true
```
Example 2:

```
Input:     1         1
          /           \
         2             2

        [1,2],     [1,null,2]

Output: false
```
Example 3:

```
Input:     1         1
          / \       / \
         2   1     1   2

        [1,2,1],   [1,1,2]

Output: false
```

Solution:

```cpp
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x, TreeNode *left, TreeNode *right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    bool isSameTree(TreeNode* p, TreeNode* q) {
        
    }
};
```

## 979. Distribute Coins in Binary Tree

Given the root of a binary tree with N nodes, each node in the tree has node.val coins, and there are N coins total.

In one move, we may choose two adjacent nodes and move one coin from one node to another.  (The move may be from parent to child, or from child to parent.)

Return the number of moves required to make every node have exactly one coin.

 

Example 1:

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/01/18/tree1.png)
```
Input: [3,0,0]
Output: 2
Explanation: From the root of the tree, we move one coin to its left child, 
and one coin to its right child.
```

Example 2:

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/01/18/tree2.png)

```
Input: [0,3,0]
Output: 3
Explanation: From the left child of the root, we move two coins to the root 
[taking two moves].  Then, we move one coin from the root of the tree to the 
right child.
```
Example 3:

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/01/18/tree3.png)

```
Input: [1,0,2]
Output: 2
```
Example 4:

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/01/18/tree4.png)

```
Input: [1,0,0,null,3]
Output: 4
```
 

Note:

- 1<= N <= 100
- 0 <= node.val <= N

Solution:

```cpp
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x, TreeNode *left, TreeNode *right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    int distributeCoins(TreeNode* root) {
        
    }
};
```

## 959. Regions Cut By Slashes

In a N x N grid composed of 1 x 1 squares, each 1 x 1 square consists of a /, \, or blank space.  These characters divide the square into contiguous regions.

(Note that backslash characters are escaped, so a \ is represented as "\\".)

Return the number of regions.

 

Example 1:
```
Input:
[
  " /",
  "/ "
]
Output: 2
Explanation: The 2x2 grid is as follows:
```

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/15/1.png)

Example 2:
```
Input:
[
  " /",
  "  "
]
Output: 1
Explanation: The 2x2 grid is as follows:
```
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/15/2.png)

Example 3:
```
Input:
[
  "\\/",
  "/\\"
]
Output: 4
Explanation: (Recall that because \ characters are escaped, "\\/" refers to \/, 
and "/\\" refers to /\.)
The 2x2 grid is as follows:
```
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/15/3.png)

Example 4:
```
Input:
[
  "/\\",
  "\\/"
]
Output: 5
Explanation: (Recall that because \ characters are escaped, "/\\" refers to /\, 
and "\\/" refers to \/.)
The 2x2 grid is as follows:
```
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/15/4.png)

Example 5:
```
Input:
[
  "//",
  "/ "
]
Output: 3
Explanation: The 2x2 grid is as follows:
```
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/15/5.png)

Note:

- 1 <= grid.length == grid[0].length <= 30
- grid[i][j] is either '/', '\', or ' '.

Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int regionsBySlashes(vector<string>& grid) {
        
    }
};
```

## 695. Max Area of Island

Given a non-empty 2D array grid of 0's and 1's, an island is a group of 1's (representing land) connected 4-directionally (horizontal or vertical.) You may assume all four edges of the grid are surrounded by water.

Find the maximum area of an island in the given 2D array. (If there is no island, the maximum area is 0.)

Example 1:
```
[[0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0],
 [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0],
 [0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],
 [0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0],
 [0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0],
 [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0],
 [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0],
 [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0]]
```
Given the above grid, return 6. Note the answer is not 11, 
because the island must be connected 4-directionally.

Example 2:

```
[[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]]

```

Given the above grid, return 0.

Note: The length of each dimension in the given grid does not exceed 50.

Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxAreaOfIsland(vector<vector<int>>& grid) {
        
    }
};
```

## 124. Binary Tree Maximum Path Sum

Given a non-empty binary tree, find the maximum path sum.

For this problem, a path is defined as any sequence of nodes from some starting node to any node in the tree along the parent-child connections. The path must contain at least one node and does not need to go through the root.

Example 1:
```
Input: [1,2,3]

       1
      / \
     2   3

Output: 6
```
Example 2:
```
Input: [-10,9,20,null,null,15,7]

   -10
   / \
  9  20
    /  \
   15   7

Output: 42
```

Solution:
```cpp
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x, TreeNode *left, TreeNode *right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    int maxPathSum(TreeNode* root) {
        
    }
};
```

# 199. Binary Tree Right Side View

Given a binary tree, imagine yourself standing on the right side of it, return the values of the nodes you can see ordered from top to bottom.

Example:
```
Input: [1,2,3,null,5,null,4]
Output: [1, 3, 4]
Explanation:

   1            <---
 /   \
2     3         <---
 \     \
  5     4       <---
```

Solution:
```cpp
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x, TreeNode *left, TreeNode *right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> rightSideView(TreeNode* root) {
        
    }
};
```

## 99. Recover Binary Search Tree

Two elements of a binary search tree (BST) are swapped by mistake.

Recover the tree without changing its structure.

Example 1:
```
Input: [1,3,null,null,2]

   1
  /
 3
  \
   2

Output: [3,1,null,null,2]

   3
  /
 1
  \
   2
```   
Example 2:
```
Input: [3,1,4,null,null,2]

  3
 / \
1   4
   /
  2

Output: [2,1,4,null,null,3]

  2
 / \
1   4
   /
  3
```  
Follow up:

- A solution using O(n) space is pretty straight forward.
- Could you devise a constant space solution?

Solution:
```cpp
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x, TreeNode *left, TreeNode *right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    void recoverTree(TreeNode* root) {
        
    }
};
```

## 110. Balanced Binary Tree

Given a binary tree, determine if it is height-balanced.

For this problem, a height-balanced binary tree is defined as:

a binary tree in which the left and right subtrees of every node differ in height by no more than 1.

 

Example 1:

Given the following tree [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]:
```
    3
   / \
  9  20
    /  \
   15   7
Return true.
```

Example 2:

```
Given the following tree [1,2,2,3,3,null,null,4,4]:

       1
      / \
     2   2
    / \
   3   3
  / \
 4   4
Return false.
```

Solution:

```cpp
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x, TreeNode *left, TreeNode *right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    bool isBalanced(TreeNode* root) {
        
    }
};
```

## 101. Symmetric Tree

Given a binary tree, check whether it is a mirror of itself (ie, symmetric around its center).

For example, this binary tree [1,2,2,3,4,4,3] is symmetric:
```
    1
   / \
  2   2
 / \ / \
3  4 4  3
```
 

But the following [1,2,2,null,3,null,3] is not:

```
    1
   / \
  2   2
   \   \
   3    3
```

Follow up: Solve it both recursively and iteratively.

Solution:
```cpp
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x, TreeNode *left, TreeNode *right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    bool isSymmetric(TreeNode* root) {
        
    }
};
```

## 114. Flatten Binary Tree to Linked List

Given a binary tree, flatten it to a linked list in-place.

For example, given the following tree:
```
    1
   / \
  2   5
 / \   \
3   4   6
```
The flattened tree should look like:

```
1
 \
  2
   \
    3
     \
      4
       \
        5
         \
          6
```

Solution:

```cpp
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x, TreeNode *left, TreeNode *right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    void flatten(TreeNode* root) {
        
    }
};

```

## 109. Convert Sorted List to Binary Search Tree

Given a singly linked list where elements are sorted in ascending order, convert it to a height balanced BST.

For this problem, a height-balanced binary tree is defined as a binary tree in which the depth of the two subtrees of every node never differ by more than 1.

Example:
```
Given the sorted linked list: [-10,-3,0,5,9],

One possible answer is: [0,-3,9,-10,null,5], which represents the following 
height balanced BST:

      0
     / \
   -3   9
   /   /
 -10  5
 ```
 
 Solution:
 ```cpp
 /**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * struct ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode *next;
 *     ListNode() : val(0), next(nullptr) {}
 *     ListNode(int x) : val(x), next(nullptr) {}
 *     ListNode(int x, ListNode *next) : val(x), next(next) {}
 * };
 */
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x, TreeNode *left, TreeNode *right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    TreeNode* sortedListToBST(ListNode* head) {
        
    }
};
 ```
 
## 679. 24 Game

You have 4 cards each containing a number from 1 to 9. You need to judge whether they could operated through *, /, +, -, (, ) to get the value of 24.

Example 1:
```
Input: [4, 1, 8, 7]
Output: True
Explanation: (8-4) * (7-1) = 24
```
Example 2:
```
Input: [1, 2, 1, 2]
Output: False
```
Note:
- The division operator / represents real division, not integer division. For example, 4 / (1 - 2/3) = 12.
- Every operation done is between two numbers. In particular, we cannot use - as a unary operator. For example, with [1, 1, 1, 1] as input, the expression -1 - 1 - 1 - 1 is not allowed.
- You cannot concatenate numbers together. For example, if the input is [1, 2, 1, 2], we cannot write this as 12 + 12.

Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool judgePoint24(vector<int>& nums) {
        
    }
};
```

## 834. Sum of Distances in Tree

An undirected, connected tree with N nodes labelled 0...N-1 and N-1 edges are given.

The ith edge connects nodes edges[i][0] and edges[i][1] together.

Return a list ans, where ans[i] is the sum of the distances between node i and all other nodes.

Example 1:
```
Input: N = 6, edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]
Output: [8,12,6,10,10,10]
Explanation: 
Here is a diagram of the given tree:
  0
 / \
1   2
   /|\
  3 4 5
We can see that dist(0,1) + dist(0,2) + dist(0,3) + dist(0,4) + dist(0,5)
equals 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 8.  Hence, answer[0] = 8, and so on.
```
Note: 1 <= N <= 10000

Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> sumOfDistancesInTree(int N, vector<vector<int>>& edges) {
        
    }
};
```

## 339. Nested List Weight Sum

Given a nested list of integers, return the sum of all integers in the list weighted by their depth.

Each element is either an integer, or a list -- whose elements may also be integers or other lists.

Example 1:
```
Input: [[1,1],2,[1,1]]
Output: 10 
Explanation: Four 1's at depth 2, one 2 at depth 1.
```
Example 2:
```
Input: [1,[4,[6]]]
Output: 27 
Explanation: One 1 at depth 1, one 4 at depth 2, and one 6 at depth 3; 1 + 4*2 + 6*3 = 27.
```

Solution:
```cpp
/**
 * // This is the interface that allows for creating nested lists.
 * // You should not implement it, or speculate about its implementation
 * class NestedInteger {
 *   public:
 *     // Constructor initializes an empty nested list.
 *     NestedInteger();
 *
 *     // Constructor initializes a single integer.
 *     NestedInteger(int value);
 *
 *     // Return true if this NestedInteger holds a single integer, rather than a nested list.
 *     bool isInteger() const;
 *
 *     // Return the single integer that this NestedInteger holds, if it holds a single integer
 *     // The result is undefined if this NestedInteger holds a nested list
 *     int getInteger() const;
 *
 *     // Set this NestedInteger to hold a single integer.
 *     void setInteger(int value);
 *
 *     // Set this NestedInteger to hold a nested list and adds a nested integer to it.
 *     void add(const NestedInteger &ni);
 *
 *     // Return the nested list that this NestedInteger holds, if it holds a nested list
 *     // The result is undefined if this NestedInteger holds a single integer
 *     const vector<NestedInteger> &getList() const;
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    int depthSum(vector<NestedInteger>& nestedList) {
        
    }
};
```

## 116. Populating Next Right Pointers in Each Node

You are given a perfect binary tree where all leaves are on the same level, and every parent has two children. The binary tree has the following definition:
```
struct Node {
  int val;
  Node *left;
  Node *right;
  Node *next;
}
```
Populate each next pointer to point to its next right node. If there is no next right node, the next pointer should be set to NULL.

Initially, all next pointers are set to NULL.

 

Follow up:

- You may only use constant extra space.
- Recursive approach is fine, you may assume implicit stack space does not count as extra space for this problem.
 

Example 1:

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/02/14/116_sample.png)

```
Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]
Output: [1,#,2,3,#,4,5,6,7,#]

Explanation: Given the above perfect binary tree (Figure A), your function 
should populate each next pointer to point to its next right node, just like 
in Figure B. The serialized output is in level order as connected by the next 
pointers, with '#' signifying the end of each level.
 ```

Constraints:

The number of nodes in the given tree is less than 4096.
-1000 <= node.val <= 1000

Solution:
```cpp
/*
// Definition for a Node.
class Node {
public:
    int val;
    Node* left;
    Node* right;
    Node* next;

    Node() : val(0), left(NULL), right(NULL), next(NULL) {}

    Node(int _val) : val(_val), left(NULL), right(NULL), next(NULL) {}

    Node(int _val, Node* _left, Node* _right, Node* _next)
        : val(_val), left(_left), right(_right), next(_next) {}
};
*/

class Solution {
public:
    Node* connect(Node* root) {
        
    }
};
```

## 546. Remove Boxes

Given several boxes with different colors represented by different positive numbers.
You may experience several rounds to remove boxes until there is no box left. Each time you can choose some continuous boxes with the same color (composed of k boxes, k >= 1), remove them and get k*k points.

Find the maximum points you can get.

Example 1:
```
Input: boxes = [1,3,2,2,2,3,4,3,1]
Output: 23
Explanation:
[1, 3, 2, 2, 2, 3, 4, 3, 1] 
----> [1, 3, 3, 4, 3, 1] (3*3=9 points) 
----> [1, 3, 3, 3, 1] (1*1=1 points) 
----> [1, 1] (3*3=9 points) 
----> [] (2*2=4 points)
 ```

Constraints:

- 1 <= boxes.length <= 100
- 1 <= boxes[i] <= 100

Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int removeBoxes(vector<int>& boxes) {
        
    }
};
```

## 133. Clone Graph

Given a reference of a node in a connected undirected graph.

Return a deep copy (clone) of the graph.

Each node in the graph contains a val (int) and a list (List[Node]) of its neighbors.
```
class Node {
    public int val;
    public List<Node> neighbors;
}
 ```

Test case format:

For simplicity sake, each node's value is the same as the node's index (1-indexed). For example, the first node with val = 1, the second node with val = 2, and so on. The graph is represented in the test case using an adjacency list.

Adjacency list is a collection of unordered lists used to represent a finite graph. Each list describes the set of neighbors of a node in the graph.

The given node will always be the first node with val = 1. You must return the copy of the given node as a reference to the cloned graph.

 

Example 1:

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/11/04/133_clone_graph_question.png)

```
Input: adjList = [[2,4],[1,3],[2,4],[1,3]]
Output: [[2,4],[1,3],[2,4],[1,3]]
Explanation: There are 4 nodes in the graph.
1st node (val = 1)'s neighbors are 2nd node (val = 2) and 4th node (val = 4).
2nd node (val = 2)'s neighbors are 1st node (val = 1) and 3rd node (val = 3).
3rd node (val = 3)'s neighbors are 2nd node (val = 2) and 4th node (val = 4).
4th node (val = 4)'s neighbors are 1st node (val = 1) and 3rd node (val = 3).
```

Example 2:

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/01/07/graph.png)

```
Input: adjList = [[]]
Output: [[]]
Explanation: Note that the input contains one empty list. The graph consists of 
only one node with val = 1 and it does not have any neighbors.
```
Example 3:

```
Input: adjList = []
Output: []
Explanation: This an empty graph, it does not have any nodes.
```
Example 4:

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/01/07/graph-1.png)

```
Input: adjList = [[2],[1]]
Output: [[2],[1]]
 ```

Constraints:

- 1 <= Node.val <= 100
- Node.val is unique for each node.
- Number of Nodes will not exceed 100.
- There is no repeated edges and no self-loops in the graph.
- The Graph is connected and all nodes can be visited starting from the given node.

Solution:
```cpp
/*
// Definition for a Node.
class Node {
public:
    int val;
    vector<Node*> neighbors;
    
    Node() {
        val = 0;
        neighbors = vector<Node*>();
    }
    
    Node(int _val) {
        val = _val;
        neighbors = vector<Node*>();
    }
    
    Node(int _val, vector<Node*> _neighbors) {
        val = _val;
        neighbors = _neighbors;
    }
};
*/

class Solution {
public:
    Node* cloneGraph(Node* node) {
        
    }
};
```

## 547. Friend Circles

There are N students in a class. Some of them are friends, while some are not. Their friendship is transitive in nature. For example, if A is a direct friend of B, and B is a direct friend of C, then A is an indirect friend of C. And we defined a friend circle is a group of students who are direct or indirect friends.

Given a N*N matrix M representing the friend relationship between students in the class. If M[i][j] = 1, then the ith and jth students are direct friends with each other, otherwise not. And you have to output the total number of friend circles among all the students.

Example 1:
```
Input: 
[[1,1,0],
 [1,1,0],
 [0,0,1]]
Output: 2
Explanation:The 0th and 1st students are direct friends, so they are in 
a friend circle. 
The 2nd student himself is in a friend circle. So return 2.
```

Example 2:
```
Input: 
[[1,1,0],
 [1,1,1],
 [0,1,1]]
Output: 1
Explanation:The 0th and 1st students are direct friends, the 1st and 2nd 
students are direct friends, 
so the 0th and 2nd students are indirect friends. All of them are in the 
same friend circle, so return 1.
```
Note:
- N is in range [1,200].
- M[i][i] = 1 for all students.
- If M[i][j] = 1, then M[j][i] = 1.

Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int findCircleNum(vector<vector<int>>& M) {
        
    }
};
```

## 332. Reconstruct Itinerary

Given a list of airline tickets represented by pairs of departure and arrival airports [from, to], reconstruct the itinerary in order. All of the tickets belong to a man who departs from JFK. Thus, the itinerary must begin with JFK.

Note:

- If there are multiple valid itineraries, you should return the itinerary that has the smallest lexical order when read as a single string. For example, the itinerary ["JFK", "LGA"] has a smaller lexical order than ["JFK", "LGB"].
- All airports are represented by three capital letters (IATA code).
- You may assume all tickets form at least one valid itinerary.
- One must use all the tickets once and only once.

Example 1:
```
Input: [["MUC", "LHR"], ["JFK", "MUC"], ["SFO", "SJC"], ["LHR", "SFO"]]
Output: ["JFK", "MUC", "LHR", "SFO", "SJC"]
```
Example 2:
```
Input: [["JFK","SFO"],["JFK","ATL"],["SFO","ATL"],["ATL","JFK"],["ATL","SFO"]]
Output: ["JFK","ATL","JFK","SFO","ATL","SFO"]
Explanation: Another possible reconstruction is ["JFK","SFO","ATL","JFK","ATL","SFO"].
             But it is larger in lexical order.
```             

Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<string> findItinerary(vector<vector<string>>& tickets) {
        
    }
};
```

## 257. Binary Tree Paths

Given a binary tree, return all root-to-leaf paths.

Note: A leaf is a node with no children.

Example:
```
Input:

   1
 /   \
2     3
 \
  5

Output: ["1->2->5", "1->3"]

Explanation: All root-to-leaf paths are: 1->2->5, 1->3
```

Solution:
```cpp
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x, TreeNode *left, TreeNode *right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    vector<string> binaryTreePaths(TreeNode* root) {
        
    }
};
```

## 980. Unique Paths III

On a 2-dimensional grid, there are 4 types of squares:

- 1 represents the starting square.  There is exactly one starting square.
- 2 represents the ending square.  There is exactly one ending square.
- 0 represents empty squares we can walk over.
- -1 represents obstacles that we cannot walk over.

Return the number of 4-directional walks from the starting square to the ending square, that walk over every non-obstacle square exactly once.

 

Example 1:
```
Input: [[1,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0],[0,0,2,-1]]
Output: 2
Explanation: We have the following two paths: 
1. (0,0),(0,1),(0,2),(0,3),(1,3),(1,2),(1,1),(1,0),(2,0),(2,1),(2,2)
2. (0,0),(1,0),(2,0),(2,1),(1,1),(0,1),(0,2),(0,3),(1,3),(1,2),(2,2)
```
Example 2:
```
Input: [[1,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,2]]
Output: 4
Explanation: We have the following four paths: 
1. (0,0),(0,1),(0,2),(0,3),(1,3),(1,2),(1,1),(1,0),(2,0),(2,1),(2,2),(2,3)
2. (0,0),(0,1),(1,1),(1,0),(2,0),(2,1),(2,2),(1,2),(0,2),(0,3),(1,3),(2,3)
3. (0,0),(1,0),(2,0),(2,1),(2,2),(1,2),(1,1),(0,1),(0,2),(0,3),(1,3),(2,3)
4. (0,0),(1,0),(2,0),(2,1),(1,1),(0,1),(0,2),(0,3),(1,3),(1,2),(2,2),(2,3)
```
Example 3:
```
Input: [[0,1],[2,0]]
Output: 0
Explanation: 
There is no path that walks over every empty square exactly once.
Note that the starting and ending square can be anywhere in the grid.
``` 

Note:

- 1 <= grid.length * grid[0].length <= 20

Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int uniquePathsIII(vector<vector<int>>& grid) {
        
    }
};
```

## 364. Nested List Weight Sum II

Given a nested list of integers, return the sum of all integers in the list weighted by their depth.

Each element is either an integer, or a list -- whose elements may also be integers or other lists.

Different from the previous question where weight is increasing from root to leaf, now the weight is defined from bottom up. i.e., the leaf level integers have weight 1, and the root level integers have the largest weight.

Example 1:
```
Input: [[1,1],2,[1,1]]
Output: 8 
Explanation: Four 1's at depth 1, one 2 at depth 2.
```

Example 2:
```
Input: [1,[4,[6]]]
Output: 17 
Explanation: One 1 at depth 3, one 4 at depth 2, and one 6 at depth 1; 1*3 + 4*2 + 6*1 = 17.
```

Solution:
```cpp
/**
 * // This is the interface that allows for creating nested lists.
 * // You should not implement it, or speculate about its implementation
 * class NestedInteger {
 *   public:
 *     // Constructor initializes an empty nested list.
 *     NestedInteger();
 *
 *     // Constructor initializes a single integer.
 *     NestedInteger(int value);
 *
 *     // Return true if this NestedInteger holds a single integer, rather than a nested list.
 *     bool isInteger() const;
 *
 *     // Return the single integer that this NestedInteger holds, if it holds a single integer
 *     // The result is undefined if this NestedInteger holds a nested list
 *     int getInteger() const;
 *
 *     // Set this NestedInteger to hold a single integer.
 *     void setInteger(int value);
 *
 *     // Set this NestedInteger to hold a nested list and adds a nested integer to it.
 *     void add(const NestedInteger &ni);
 *
 *     // Return the nested list that this NestedInteger holds, if it holds a nested list
 *     // The result is undefined if this NestedInteger holds a single integer
 *     const vector<NestedInteger> &getList() const;
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    int depthSumInverse(vector<NestedInteger>& nestedList) {
        
    }
};
```

## 753. Cracking the Safe

There is a box protected by a password. The password is a sequence of n digits where each digit can be one of the first k digits 0, 1, ..., k-1.

While entering a password, the last n digits entered will automatically be matched against the correct password.

For example, assuming the correct password is "345", if you type "012345", the box will open because the correct password matches the suffix of the entered password.

Return any password of minimum length that is guaranteed to open the box at some point of entering it.

 

Example 1:
```
Input: n = 1, k = 2
Output: "01"
Note: "10" will be accepted too.
```
Example 2:

```
Input: n = 2, k = 2
Output: "00110"
Note: "01100", "10011", "11001" will be accepted too.
```
 

Note:

- n will be in the range [1, 4].
- k will be in the range [1, 10].
- k^n will be at most 4096.

Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    string crackSafe(int n, int k) {
        
    }
};
```

## 337. House Robber III

The thief has found himself a new place for his thievery again. There is only one entrance to this area, called the "root." Besides the root, each house has one and only one parent house. After a tour, the smart thief realized that "all houses in this place forms a binary tree". It will automatically contact the police if two directly-linked houses were broken into on the same night.

Determine the maximum amount of money the thief can rob tonight without alerting the police.

Example 1:
```
Input: [3,2,3,null,3,null,1]

     3
    / \
   2   3
    \   \ 
     3   1

Output: 7 
Explanation: Maximum amount of money the thief can rob = 3 + 3 + 1 = 7.
```

Example 2:
```
Input: [3,4,5,1,3,null,1]

     3
    / \
   4   5
  / \   \ 
 1   3   1

Output: 9
Explanation: Maximum amount of money the thief can rob = 4 + 5 = 9.
```

Solution:
```cpp
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x, TreeNode *left, TreeNode *right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    int rob(TreeNode* root) {
        
    }
};
```

## 329. Longest Increasing Path in a Matrix

Given an integer matrix, find the length of the longest increasing path.

From each cell, you can either move to four directions: left, right, up or down. You may NOT move diagonally or move outside of the boundary (i.e. wrap-around is not allowed).

Example 1:
```
Input: nums = 
[
  [9,9,4],
  [6,6,8],
  [2,1,1]
] 
Output: 4 
Explanation: The longest increasing path is [1, 2, 6, 9].
```
Example 2:
```
Input: nums = 
[
  [3,4,5],
  [3,2,6],
  [2,2,1]
] 
Output: 4 
Explanation: The longest increasing path is [3, 4, 5, 6]. Moving diagonally is not allowed.
```

Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int longestIncreasingPath(vector<vector<int>>& matrix) {
        
    }
};
```

## 112. Path Sum

Given a binary tree and a sum, determine if the tree has a root-to-leaf path such that adding up all the values along the path equals the given sum.

Note: A leaf is a node with no children.

Example:

Given the below binary tree and sum = 22,
```
      5
     / \
    4   8
   /   / \
  11  13  4
 /  \      \
7    2      1
```
return true, as there exist a root-to-leaf path 5->4->11->2 which sum is 22.

Solution:
```cpp
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x, TreeNode *left, TreeNode *right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    bool hasPathSum(TreeNode* root, int sum) {
        
    }
};
```

## 417. Pacific Atlantic Water Flow

Given an m x n matrix of non-negative integers representing the height of each unit cell in a continent, the "Pacific ocean" touches the left and top edges of the matrix and the "Atlantic ocean" touches the right and bottom edges.

Water can only flow in four directions (up, down, left, or right) from a cell to another one with height equal or lower.

Find the list of grid coordinates where water can flow to both the Pacific and Atlantic ocean.

Note:

- The order of returned grid coordinates does not matter.
- Both m and n are less than 150.
 

Example:
```
Given the following 5x5 matrix:

  Pacific ~   ~   ~   ~   ~ 
       ~  1   2   2   3  (5) *
       ~  3   2   3  (4) (4) *
       ~  2   4  (5)  3   1  *
       ~ (6) (7)  1   4   5  *
       ~ (5)  1   1   2   4  *
          *   *   *   *   * Atlantic

Return:

[[0, 4], [1, 3], [1, 4], [2, 2], [3, 0], [3, 1], [4, 0]] (positions with 
parentheses in above matrix).
```

Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<int>> pacificAtlantic(vector<vector<int>>& matrix) {
        
    }
};
```

## 529. Minesweeper

Let's play the minesweeper game (Wikipedia, online game)!

You are given a 2D char matrix representing the game board. 'M' represents an unrevealed mine, 'E' represents an unrevealed empty square, 'B' represents a revealed blank square that has no adjacent (above, below, left, right, and all 4 diagonals) mines, digit ('1' to '8') represents how many mines are adjacent to this revealed square, and finally 'X' represents a revealed mine.

Now given the next click position (row and column indices) among all the unrevealed squares ('M' or 'E'), return the board after revealing this position according to the following rules:

- If a mine ('M') is revealed, then the game is over - change it to 'X'.
- If an empty square ('E') with no adjacent mines is revealed, then change it to revealed blank ('B') and all of its adjacent unrevealed squares should be revealed recursively.
- If an empty square ('E') with at least one adjacent mine is revealed, then change it to a digit ('1' to '8') representing the number of adjacent mines.
- Return the board when no more squares will be revealed.
 

Example 1:
```
Input: 

[['E', 'E', 'E', 'E', 'E'],
 ['E', 'E', 'M', 'E', 'E'],
 ['E', 'E', 'E', 'E', 'E'],
 ['E', 'E', 'E', 'E', 'E']]

Click : [3,0]

Output: 

[['B', '1', 'E', '1', 'B'],
 ['B', '1', 'M', '1', 'B'],
 ['B', '1', '1', '1', 'B'],
 ['B', 'B', 'B', 'B', 'B']]

Explanation:
```
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/10/12/minesweeper_example_1.png)

Example 2:
```
Input: 

[['B', '1', 'E', '1', 'B'],
 ['B', '1', 'M', '1', 'B'],
 ['B', '1', '1', '1', 'B'],
 ['B', 'B', 'B', 'B', 'B']]

Click : [1,2]

Output: 

[['B', '1', 'E', '1', 'B'],
 ['B', '1', 'X', '1', 'B'],
 ['B', '1', '1', '1', 'B'],
 ['B', 'B', 'B', 'B', 'B']]

Explanation:
```
 ![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/10/12/minesweeper_example_2.png)

Note:

- The range of the input matrix's height and width is [1,50].
- The click position will only be an unrevealed square ('M' or 'E'), which also means the input board contains at least one clickable square.
- The input board won't be a stage when game is over (some mines have been revealed).
- For simplicity, not mentioned rules should be ignored in this problem. For example, you don't need to reveal all the unrevealed mines when the game is over, consider any cases that you will win the game or flag any squares.

Solution:
```cpp

## 489. Robot Room Cleaner

Given a robot cleaner in a room modeled as a grid.

Each cell in the grid can be empty or blocked.

The robot cleaner with 4 given APIs can move forward, turn left or turn right. Each turn it made is 90 degrees.

When it tries to move into a blocked cell, its bumper sensor detects the obstacle and it stays on the current cell.

Design an algorithm to clean the entire room using only the 4 given APIs shown below.
```
interface Robot {
  // returns true if next cell is open and robot moves into the cell.
  // returns false if next cell is obstacle and robot stays on the current cell.
  boolean move();

  // Robot will stay on the same cell after calling turnLeft/turnRight.
  // Each turn will be 90 degrees.
  void turnLeft();
  void turnRight();

  // Clean the current cell.
  void clean();
}
```
Example:

```
Input:
room = [
  [1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1],
  [1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1],
  [1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1],
  [0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0],
  [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]
],
row = 1,
col = 3

Explanation:
All grids in the room are marked by either 0 or 1.
0 means the cell is blocked, while 1 means the cell is accessible.
The robot initially starts at the position of row=1, col=3.
From the top left corner, its position is one row below and three columns right.
```
Notes:

- The input is only given to initialize the room and the robot's position internally. You must solve this problem "blindfolded". In other words, you must control the robot using only the mentioned 4 APIs, without knowing the room layout and the initial robot's position.
- The robot's initial position will always be in an accessible cell.
- The initial direction of the robot will be facing up.
- All accessible cells are connected, which means the all cells marked as 1 will be accessible by the robot.
- Assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by wall.

Solution:
```cpp
/**
 * // This is the robot's control interface.
 * // You should not implement it, or speculate about its implementation
 * class Robot {
 *   public:
 *     // Returns true if the cell in front is open and robot moves into the cell.
 *     // Returns false if the cell in front is blocked and robot stays in the current cell.
 *     bool move();
 *
 *     // Robot will stay in the same cell after calling turnLeft/turnRight.
 *     // Each turn will be 90 degrees.
 *     void turnLeft();
 *     void turnRight();
 *
 *     // Clean the current cell.
 *     void clean();
 * };
 */

class Solution {
public:
    void cleanRoom(Robot& robot) {
        
    }
};
```

## 106. Construct Binary Tree from Inorder and Postorder Traversal

Given inorder and postorder traversal of a tree, construct the binary tree.

Note:
You may assume that duplicates do not exist in the tree.

For example, given
```
inorder = [9,3,15,20,7]
postorder = [9,15,7,20,3]
```
Return the following binary tree:

```
    3
   / \
  9  20
    /  \
   15   7
```

Solution:

```cpp
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x, TreeNode *left, TreeNode *right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    TreeNode* buildTree(vector<int>& inorder, vector<int>& postorder) {
        
    }
};
```

## 207. Course Schedule

There are a total of numCourses courses you have to take, labeled from 0 to numCourses-1.

Some courses may have prerequisites, for example to take course 0 you have to first take course 1, which is expressed as a pair: [0,1]

Given the total number of courses and a list of prerequisite pairs, is it possible for you to finish all courses?

 

Example 1:
```
Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0]]
Output: true
Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. 
             To take course 1 you should have finished course 0. So it is possible.
```             
Example 2:
```
Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0],[0,1]]
Output: false
Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. 
             To take course 1 you should have finished course 0, and to take course 0 you should
             also have finished course 1. So it is impossible.
```             
 

Constraints:

- The input prerequisites is a graph represented by a list of edges, not adjacency matrices. Read more about how a graph is represented.
- You may assume that there are no duplicate edges in the input prerequisites.
- 1 <= numCourses <= 10^5

Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool canFinish(int numCourses, vector<vector<int>>& prerequisites) {
        
    }
};
```

## 111. Minimum Depth of Binary Tree

Given a binary tree, find its minimum depth.

The minimum depth is the number of nodes along the shortest path from the root node down to the nearest leaf node.

Note: A leaf is a node with no children.

Example:

Given binary tree [3,9,20,null,null,15,7],
```
    3
   / \
  9  20
    /  \
   15   7
```
return its minimum depth = 2.

Solution:
```cpp
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x, TreeNode *left, TreeNode *right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    int minDepth(TreeNode* root) {
        
    }
};
```

## 947. Most Stones Removed with Same Row or Column

On a 2D plane, we place stones at some integer coordinate points.  Each coordinate point may have at most one stone.

Now, a move consists of removing a stone that shares a column or row with another stone on the grid.

What is the largest possible number of moves we can make?

 

Example 1:
```
Input: stones = [[0,0],[0,1],[1,0],[1,2],[2,1],[2,2]]
Output: 5
```
Example 2:

```
Input: stones = [[0,0],[0,2],[1,1],[2,0],[2,2]]
Output: 3
```
Example 3:

```
Input: stones = [[0,0]]
Output: 0
```
 

Note:

- 1 <= stones.length <= 1000
- 0 <= stones[i][j] < 10000

Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int removeStones(vector<vector<int>>& stones) {
        
    }
};
```

## 638. Shopping Offers

In LeetCode Store, there are some kinds of items to sell. Each item has a price.

However, there are some special offers, and a special offer consists of one or more different kinds of items with a sale price.

You are given the each item's price, a set of special offers, and the number we need to buy for each item. The job is to output the lowest price you have to pay for exactly certain items as given, where you could make optimal use of the special offers.

Each special offer is represented in the form of an array, the last number represents the price you need to pay for this special offer, other numbers represents how many specific items you could get if you buy this offer.

You could use any of special offers as many times as you want.

Example 1:
```
Input: [2,5], [[3,0,5],[1,2,10]], [3,2]
Output: 14
Explanation: 
There are two kinds of items, A and B. Their prices are $2 and $5 respectively. 
In special offer 1, you can pay $5 for 3A and 0B
In special offer 2, you can pay $10 for 1A and 2B. 
You need to buy 3A and 2B, so you may pay $10 for 1A and 2B (special offer #2), and $4 for 2A.
```
Example 2:
```
Input: [2,3,4], [[1,1,0,4],[2,2,1,9]], [1,2,1]
Output: 11
Explanation: 
The price of A is $2, and $3 for B, $4 for C. 
You may pay $4 for 1A and 1B, and $9 for 2A ,2B and 1C. 
You need to buy 1A ,2B and 1C, so you may pay $4 for 1A and 1B (special offer #1), and $3 for 1B, $4 for 1C. 
You cannot add more items, though only $9 for 2A ,2B and 1C.
```
Note:
- There are at most 6 kinds of items, 100 special offers.
- For each item, you need to buy at most 6 of them.
- You are not allowed to buy more items than you want, even if that would lower the overall price.

Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int shoppingOffers(vector<int>& price, vector<vector<int>>& special, vector<int>& needs) {
        
    }
};
```

## 863. All Nodes Distance K in Binary Tree

We are given a binary tree (with root node root), a target node, and an integer value K.

Return a list of the values of all nodes that have a distance K from the target node.  The answer can be returned in any order.

 

Example 1:
```
Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], target = 5, K = 2

Output: [7,4,1]

Explanation: 
The nodes that are a distance 2 from the target node (with value 5)
have values 7, 4, and 1.



Note that the inputs "root" and "target" are actually TreeNodes.
The descriptions of the inputs above are just serializations of these objects.
```
![](https://s3-lc-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2018/06/28/sketch0.png)

Note:

- The given tree is non-empty.
- Each node in the tree has unique values 0 <= node.val <= 500.
- The target node is a node in the tree.
- 0 <= K <= 1000.

Solution:
```cpp
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(NULL), right(NULL) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> distanceK(TreeNode* root, TreeNode* target, int K) {
        
    }
};
```

## 130. Surrounded Regions

Given a 2D board containing 'X' and 'O' (the letter O), capture all regions surrounded by 'X'.

A region is captured by flipping all 'O's into 'X's in that surrounded region.

Example:
```
X X X X
X O O X
X X O X
X O X X
```
After running your function, the board should be:
```
X X X X
X X X X
X X X X
X O X X
```
Explanation:

Surrounded regions shouldn’t be on the border, which means that any 'O' on the border of the board are not flipped to 'X'. Any 'O' that is not on the border and it is not connected to an 'O' on the border will be flipped to 'X'. Two cells are connected if they are adjacent cells connected horizontally or vertically.

Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    void solve(vector<vector<char>>& board) {
        
    }
};
```

## 542. 01 Matrix

Given a matrix consists of 0 and 1, find the distance of the nearest 0 for each cell.

The distance between two adjacent cells is 1.

 

Example 1:
```
Input:
[[0,0,0],
 [0,1,0],
 [0,0,0]]

Output:
[[0,0,0],
 [0,1,0],
 [0,0,0]]
``` 
Example 2:
```
Input:
[[0,0,0],
 [0,1,0],
 [1,1,1]]

Output:
[[0,0,0],
 [0,1,0],
 [1,2,1]]
``` 

Note:

- The number of elements of the given matrix will not exceed 10,000.
- There are at least one 0 in the given matrix.
- The cells are adjacent in only four directions: up, down, left and right.

Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<int>> updateMatrix(vector<vector<int>>& matrix) {
        
    }
};
```

## 690. Employee Importance

You are given a data structure of employee information, which includes the employee's unique id, their importance value and their direct subordinates' id.

For example, employee 1 is the leader of employee 2, and employee 2 is the leader of employee 3. They have importance value 15, 10 and 5, respectively. Then employee 1 has a data structure like [1, 15, [2]], and employee 2 has [2, 10, [3]], and employee 3 has [3, 5, []]. Note that although employee 3 is also a subordinate of employee 1, the relationship is not direct.

Now given the employee information of a company, and an employee id, you need to return the total importance value of this employee and all their subordinates.

Example 1:
```
Input: [[1, 5, [2, 3]], [2, 3, []], [3, 3, []]], 1
Output: 11

Explanation:
Employee 1 has importance value 5, and he has two direct subordinates: 
employee 2 and employee 3. They both have importance value 3. So the 
total importance value of employee 1 is 5 + 3 + 3 = 11.
```

Note:

- One employee has at most one direct leader and may have several subordinates.
- The maximum number of employees won't exceed 2000.

Solution:
```cpp
/*
// Definition for Employee.
class Employee {
public:
    int id;
    int importance;
    vector<int> subordinates;
};
*/

class Solution {
public:
    int getImportance(vector<Employee*> employees, int id) {
        
    }
};
```

## 113. Path Sum II

Given a binary tree and a sum, find all root-to-leaf paths where each path's sum equals the given sum.

Note: A leaf is a node with no children.

Example:

Given the below binary tree and sum = 22,
```
      5
     / \
    4   8
   /   / \
  11  13  4
 /  \    / \
7    2  5   1
```
Return:
```
[
   [5,4,11,2],
   [5,8,4,5]
]
```

Solution:
```cpp
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x, TreeNode *left, TreeNode *right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<int>> pathSum(TreeNode* root, int sum) {
        
    }
};
```

## 98. Validate Binary Search Tree

Given a binary tree, determine if it is a valid binary search tree (BST).

Assume a BST is defined as follows:

The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key.
The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key.
Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.
 

Example 1:
```
    2
   / \
  1   3

Input: [2,1,3]
Output: true
```
Example 2:
```
    5
   / \
  1   4
     / \
    3   6

Input: [5,1,4,null,null,3,6]
Output: false
Explanation: The root node's value is 5 but its right child's value is 4.
```

Solution:
```cpp
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x, TreeNode *left, TreeNode *right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    bool isValidBST(TreeNode* root) {
        
    }
};
```

## 430. Flatten a Multilevel Doubly Linked List

You are given a doubly linked list which in addition to the next and previous pointers, it could have a child pointer, which may or may not point to a separate doubly linked list. These child lists may have one or more children of their own, and so on, to produce a multilevel data structure, as shown in the example below.

Flatten the list so that all the nodes appear in a single-level, doubly linked list. You are given the head of the first level of the list.

 

Example 1:
```
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5,6,null,null,null,7,8,9,10,null,null,11,12]
Output: [1,2,3,7,8,11,12,9,10,4,5,6]
Explanation:

The multilevel linked list in the input is as follows:
```

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/10/12/multilevellinkedlist.png)

```
After flattening the multilevel linked list it becomes:
```

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/10/12/multilevellinkedlistflattened.png)

Example 2:
```
Input: head = [1,2,null,3]
Output: [1,3,2]
Explanation:

The input multilevel linked list is as follows:

  1---2---NULL
  |
  3---NULL
```
Example 3:

```
Input: head = []
Output: []
 
```

How multilevel linked list is represented in test case:

We use the multilevel linked list from Example 1 above:

```
 1---2---3---4---5---6--NULL
         |
         7---8---9---10--NULL
             |
             11--12--NULL
```
The serialization of each level is as follows:

```
[1,2,3,4,5,6,null]
[7,8,9,10,null]
[11,12,null]
```
To serialize all levels together we will add nulls in each level to signify no node connects to the upper node of the previous level. The serialization becomes:

```
[1,2,3,4,5,6,null]
[null,null,7,8,9,10,null]
[null,11,12,null]
```
Merging the serialization of each level and removing trailing nulls we obtain:

```
[1,2,3,4,5,6,null,null,null,7,8,9,10,null,null,11,12]
```
 

Constraints:

- Number of Nodes will not exceed 1000.
- 1 <= Node.val <= 10^5

Solution:
```cpp
/*
// Definition for a Node.
class Node {
public:
    int val;
    Node* prev;
    Node* next;
    Node* child;
};
*/

class Solution {
public:
    Node* flatten(Node* head) {
        
    }
};
```

## 494. Target Sum

You are given a list of non-negative integers, a1, a2, ..., an, and a target, S. Now you have 2 symbols + and -. For each integer, you should choose one from + and - as its new symbol.

Find out how many ways to assign symbols to make sum of integers equal to target S.

Example 1:
```
Input: nums is [1, 1, 1, 1, 1], S is 3. 
Output: 5
Explanation: 

-1+1+1+1+1 = 3
+1-1+1+1+1 = 3
+1+1-1+1+1 = 3
+1+1+1-1+1 = 3
+1+1+1+1-1 = 3

There are 5 ways to assign symbols to make the sum of nums be target 3.
 ```

Constraints:

- The length of the given array is positive and will not exceed 20.
- The sum of elements in the given array will not exceed 1000.
- Your output answer is guaranteed to be fitted in a 32-bit integer.

Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int findTargetSumWays(vector<int>& nums, int S) {
        
    }
};
```

## 117. Populating Next Right Pointers in Each Node II

Given a binary tree
```
struct Node {
  int val;
  Node *left;
  Node *right;
  Node *next;
}
```
Populate each next pointer to point to its next right node. If there is no next right node, the next pointer should be set to NULL.

Initially, all next pointers are set to NULL.

 

Follow up:

- You may only use constant extra space.
- Recursive approach is fine, you may assume implicit stack space does not count as extra space for this problem.
 

Example 1:

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/02/15/117_sample.png)
```
Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5,null,7]
Output: [1,#,2,3,#,4,5,7,#]
Explanation: Given the above binary tree (Figure A), your function should 
populate each next pointer to point to its next right node, just like in 
Figure B. The serialized output is in level order as connected by the next
pointers, with '#' signifying the end of each level.
``` 

Constraints:

- The number of nodes in the given tree is less than 6000.
- -100 <= node.val <= 100

Solution:
```cpp
/*
// Definition for a Node.
class Node {
public:
    int val;
    Node* left;
    Node* right;
    Node* next;

    Node() : val(0), left(NULL), right(NULL), next(NULL) {}

    Node(int _val) : val(_val), left(NULL), right(NULL), next(NULL) {}

    Node(int _val, Node* _left, Node* _right, Node* _next)
        : val(_val), left(_left), right(_right), next(_next) {}
};
*/

class Solution {
public:
    Node* connect(Node* root) {
        
    }
};
```

## 1110. Delete Nodes And Return Forest

Given the root of a binary tree, each node in the tree has a distinct value.

After deleting all nodes with a value in to_delete, we are left with a forest (a disjoint union of trees).

Return the roots of the trees in the remaining forest.  You may return the result in any order.

 

Example 1:

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/07/01/screen-shot-2019-07-01-at-53836-pm.png)
```
Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7], to_delete = [3,5]
Output: [[1,2,null,4],[6],[7]]
``` 

Constraints:

- The number of nodes in the given tree is at most 1000.
- Each node has a distinct value between 1 and 1000.
- to_delete.length <= 1000
- to_delete contains distinct values between 1 and 1000.

Solution:
```cpp
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x, TreeNode *left, TreeNode *right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    vector<TreeNode*> delNodes(TreeNode* root, vector<int>& to_delete) {
        
    }
};
```

## 897. Increasing Order Search Tree

Given a binary search tree, rearrange the tree in in-order so that the leftmost node in the tree is now the root of the tree, and every node has no left child and only 1 right child.
```
Example 1:
Input: [5,3,6,2,4,null,8,1,null,null,null,7,9]

       5
      / \
    3    6
   / \    \
  2   4    8
 /        / \ 
1        7   9

Output: [1,null,2,null,3,null,4,null,5,null,6,null,7,null,8,null,9]

 1
  \
   2
    \
     3
      \
       4
        \
         5
          \
           6
            \
             7
              \
               8
                \
                 9  
 
```
Constraints:

- The number of nodes in the given tree will be between 1 and 100.
- Each node will have a unique integer value from 0 to 1000.

Solution:
```cpp
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;

## 749. Contain Virus

A virus is spreading rapidly, and your task is to quarantine the infected area by installing walls.

The world is modeled as a 2-D array of cells, where 0 represents uninfected cells, and 1 represents cells contaminated with the virus. A wall (and only one wall) can be installed between any two 4-directionally adjacent cells, on the shared boundary.

Every night, the virus spreads to all neighboring cells in all four directions unless blocked by a wall. Resources are limited. Each day, you can install walls around only one region -- the affected area (continuous block of infected cells) that threatens the most uninfected cells the following night. There will never be a tie.

Can you save the day? If so, what is the number of walls required? If not, and the world becomes fully infected, return the number of walls used.

Example 1:
```
Input: grid = 
[[0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1],
 [0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1],
 [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1],
 [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]]
Output: 10
Explanation:
There are 2 contaminated regions.
On the first day, add 5 walls to quarantine the viral region on the left. 
The board after the virus spreads is:

[[0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1],
 [0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1],
 [0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1],
 [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]]

On the second day, add 5 walls to quarantine the viral region on the right. 
The virus is fully contained.
```
Example 2:
```
Input: grid = 
[[1,1,1],
 [1,0,1],
 [1,1,1]]
Output: 4
Explanation: Even though there is only one cell saved, there are 4 walls built.
Notice that walls are only built on the shared boundary of two different cells.
```
Example 3:
```
Input: grid = 
[[1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0],
 [1,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,1],
 [1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0]]
Output: 13
Explanation: The region on the left only builds two new walls.
```
Note:
- The number of rows and columns of grid will each be in the range [1, 50].
- Each grid[i][j] will be either 0 or 1.
- Throughout the described process, there is always a contiguous viral region that will infect strictly more uncontaminated squares in the next round.

Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int containVirus(vector<vector<int>>& grid) {
        
    }
};
```

## 743. Network Delay Time

There are N network nodes, labelled 1 to N.

Given times, a list of travel times as directed edges times[i] = (u, v, w), where u is the source node, v is the target node, and w is the time it takes for a signal to travel from source to target.

Now, we send a signal from a certain node K. How long will it take for all nodes to receive the signal? If it is impossible, return -1.

 

Example 1:

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/05/23/931_example_1.png)

Input: times = [[2,1,1],[2,3,1],[3,4,1]], N = 4, K = 2
Output: 2
 

Note:

- N will be in the range [1, 100].
- K will be in the range [1, N].
- The length of times will be in the range [1, 6000].
- All edges times[i] = (u, v, w) will have 1 <= u, v <= N and 0 <= w <= 100.

Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int networkDelayTime(vector<vector<int>>& times, int N, int K) {
        
    }
};
```

## 210. Course Schedule II

There are a total of n courses you have to take, labeled from 0 to n-1.

Some courses may have prerequisites, for example to take course 0 you have to first take course 1, which is expressed as a pair: [0,1]

Given the total number of courses and a list of prerequisite pairs, return the ordering of courses you should take to finish all courses.

There may be multiple correct orders, you just need to return one of them. If it is impossible to finish all courses, return an empty array.

Example 1:
```
Input: 2, [[1,0]] 
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. To take course 1 you should have finished   
             course 0. So the correct course order is [0,1] .
```
Example 2:
```
Input: 4, [[1,0],[2,0],[3,1],[3,2]]
Output: [0,1,2,3] or [0,2,1,3]
Explanation: There are a total of 4 courses to take. To take course 3 you should have finished both     
             courses 1 and 2. Both courses 1 and 2 should be taken after you finished course 0. 
             So one correct course order is [0,1,2,3]. Another correct ordering is [0,2,1,3] .
```
Note:

- The input prerequisites is a graph represented by a list of edges, not adjacency matrices. Read more about how a graph is represented.
- You may assume that there are no duplicate edges in the input prerequisites.

Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> findOrder(int numCourses, vector<vector<int>>& prerequisites) {
        
    }
};
```

## 924. Minimize Malware Spread

In a network of nodes, each node i is directly connected to another node j if and only if graph[i][j] = 1.

Some nodes initial are initially infected by malware.  Whenever two nodes are directly connected and at least one of those two nodes is infected by malware, both nodes will be infected by malware.  This spread of malware will continue until no more nodes can be infected in this manner.

Suppose M(initial) is the final number of nodes infected with malware in the entire network, after the spread of malware stops.

We will remove one node from the initial list.  Return the node that if removed, would minimize M(initial).  If multiple nodes could be removed to minimize M(initial), return such a node with the smallest index.

Note that if a node was removed from the initial list of infected nodes, it may still be infected later as a result of the malware spread.

 

Example 1:
```
Input: graph = [[1,1,0],[1,1,0],[0,0,1]], initial = [0,1]
Output: 0
```
Example 2:
```
Input: graph = [[1,0,0],[0,1,0],[0,0,1]], initial = [0,2]
Output: 0
```
Example 3:
```
Input: graph = [[1,1,1],[1,1,1],[1,1,1]], initial = [1,2]
Output: 1
``` 

Note:

- 1 < graph.length = graph[0].length <= 300
- 0 <= graph[i][j] == graph[j][i] <= 1
- graph[i][i] == 1
- 1 <= initial.length <= graph.length
- 0 <= initial[i] < graph.length

Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minMalwareSpread(vector<vector<int>>& graph, vector<int>& initial) {
        
    }
};
```

## 366. Find Leaves of Binary Tree

Given a binary tree, collect a tree's nodes as if you were doing this: Collect and remove all leaves, repeat until the tree is empty.

 

Example:
```
Input: [1,2,3,4,5]
  
          1
         / \
        2   3
       / \     
      4   5    

Output: [[4,5,3],[2],[1]]
 ```

Explanation:

1. Removing the leaves [4,5,3] would result in this tree:

```
          1
         / 
        2          
 ```

2. Now removing the leaf [2] would result in this tree:  
 ```

          1          
   
 ```

3. Now removing the leaf [1] would result in the empty tree:
  
 ```
          []           
 ```
[[3,5,4],[2],[1]], [[3,4,5],[2],[1]], etc, are also consider correct answers since per each level it doesn't matter the order on which elements are returned.

Solution:
```cpp
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x, TreeNode *left, TreeNode *right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<int>> findLeaves(TreeNode* root) {
        
    }
};
```

## 513. Find Bottom Left Tree Value

Given a binary tree, find the leftmost value in the last row of the tree.

Example 1:
```
Input:

    2
   / \
  1   3

Output:
1
```
Example 2:
```
Input:

        1
       / \
      2   3
     /   / \
    4   5   6
       /
      7

Output:
7
```
Note: You may assume the tree (i.e., the given root node) is not NULL.

Solution:
```cpp
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x, TreeNode *left, TreeNode *right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    int findBottomLeftValue(TreeNode* root) {
        
    }
};
```

## 721. Accounts Merge

Given a list accounts, each element accounts[i] is a list of strings, where the first element accounts[i][0] is a name, and the rest of the elements are emails representing emails of the account.

Now, we would like to merge these accounts. Two accounts definitely belong to the same person if there is some email that is common to both accounts. Note that even if two accounts have the same name, they may belong to different people as people could have the same name. A person can have any number of accounts initially, but all of their accounts definitely have the same name.

After merging the accounts, return the accounts in the following format: the first element of each account is the name, and the rest of the elements are emails in sorted order. The accounts themselves can be returned in any order.

Example 1:
```
Input: 
accounts = [
    ["John", "johnsmith@mail.com", "john00@mail.com"], 
    ["John", "johnnybravo@mail.com"], 
    ["John", "johnsmith@mail.com", "john_newyork@mail.com"], 
    ["Mary", "mary@mail.com"]
]

Output: [
    ["John", 'john00@mail.com', 'john_newyork@mail.com', 'johnsmith@mail.com'],  
    ["John", "johnnybravo@mail.com"], ["Mary", "mary@mail.com"]]
    
Explanation: 

The first and third John's are the same person as they have the common email
"johnsmith@mail.com".
The second John and Mary are different people as none of their email addresses
are used by other accounts.
We could return these lists in any order, for example the answer [
['Mary', 'mary@mail.com'], ['John', 'johnnybravo@mail.com'], 
['John', 'john00@mail.com', 'john_newyork@mail.com', 'johnsmith@mail.com']] would 
still be accepted.
```
Note:

- The length of accounts will be in the range [1, 1000].
- The length of accounts[i] will be in the range [1, 10].
- The length of accounts[i][j] will be in the range [1, 30].

Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<string>> accountsMerge(vector<vector<string>>& accounts) {
        
    }
};
```

## 664. Strange Printer

There is a strange printer with the following two special requirements:

- The printer can only print a sequence of the same character each time.
- At each turn, the printer can print new characters starting from and ending at any places, and will cover the original existing characters.

Given a string consists of lower English letters only, your job is to count the minimum number of turns the printer needed in order to print it.

Example 1:
```
Input: "aaabbb"
Output: 2
Explanation: Print "aaa" first and then print "bbb".
```
Example 2:
```
Input: "aba"
Output: 2
Explanation: Print "aaa" first and then print "b" from the second place of the string, 
which will cover the existing character 'a'.
```
Hint: Length of the given string will not exceed 100.

Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int strangePrinter(string s) {
        
    }
};
```

## 314. Binary Tree Vertical Order Traversal

Given a binary tree, return the vertical order traversal of its nodes' values. (ie, from top to bottom, column by column).

If two nodes are in the same row and column, the order should be from left to right.

Examples 1:
```
Input: [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]

   3
  /\
 /  \
 9  20
    /\
   /  \
  15   7 

Output:

[
  [9],
  [3,15],
  [20],
  [7]
]
```
Examples 2:
```
Input: [3,9,8,4,0,1,7]

     3
    /\
   /  \
   9   8
  /\  /\
 /  \/  \
 4  01   7 

Output:

[
  [4],
  [9],
  [3,0,1],
  [8],
  [7]
]
```
Examples 3:
```
Input: [3,9,8,4,0,1,7,null,null,null,2,5] 
(0's right child is 2 and 1's left child is 5)

     3
    /\
   /  \
   9   8
  /\  /\
 /  \/  \
 4  01   7
    /\
   /  \
   5   2

Output:

[
  [4],
  [9,5],
  [3,0,1],
  [8,2],
  [7]
]
```

Solution:
```cpp
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x, TreeNode *left, TreeNode *right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<int>> verticalOrder(TreeNode* root) {
        
    }
};
```

## 472. Concatenated Words

Given a list of words (without duplicates), please write a program that returns all concatenated words in the given list of words.
A concatenated word is defined as a string that is comprised entirely of at least two shorter words in the given array.

Example:
```
Input: [ 
    "cat","cats","catsdogcats","dog","dogcatsdog",
    "hippopotamuses","rat","ratcatdogcat"]

Output: ["catsdogcats","dogcatsdog","ratcatdogcat"]

Explanation: "catsdogcats" can be concatenated by "cats", "dog" and "cats"; 
 "dogcatsdog" can be concatenated by "dog", "cats" and "dog"; 
"ratcatdogcat" can be concatenated by "rat", "cat", "dog" and "cat".
```
Note:
- The number of elements of the given array will not exceed 10,000
- The length sum of elements in the given array will not exceed 600,000.
- All the input string will only include lower case letters.
- The returned elements order does not matter.

Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<string> findAllConcatenatedWordsInADict(vector<string>& words) {
        
    }
};
```

## 872. Leaf-Similar Trees

Consider all the leaves of a binary tree.  From left to right order, the values of those leaves form a leaf value sequence.

![](https://s3-lc-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2018/07/16/tree.png)

For example, in the given tree above, the leaf value sequence is (6, 7, 4, 9, 8).

Two binary trees are considered leaf-similar if their leaf value sequence is the same.

Return true if and only if the two given trees with head nodes root1 and root2 are leaf-similar.

 

Constraints:

- Both of the given trees will have between 1 and 200 nodes.
- Both of the given trees will have values between 0 and 200

Solution:
```cpp
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x, TreeNode *left, TreeNode *right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    bool leafSimilar(TreeNode* root1, TreeNode* root2) {
        
    }
};
```

## 934. Shortest Bridge

In a given 2D binary array A, there are two islands.  (An island is a 4-directionally connected group of 1s not connected to any other 1s.)

Now, we may change 0s to 1s so as to connect the two islands together to form 1 island.

Return the smallest number of 0s that must be flipped.  (It is guaranteed that the answer is at least 1.)

 

Example 1:
```
Input: A = [[0,1],[1,0]]
Output: 1
```
Example 2:

```
Input: A = [[0,1,0],[0,0,0],[0,0,1]]
Output: 2
```
Example 3:

```
Input: A = [[1,1,1,1,1],[1,0,0,0,1],[1,0,1,0,1],[1,0,0,0,1],[1,1,1,1,1]]
Output: 1
```
 

Constraints:

- 2 <= A.length == A[0].length <= 100
- A[i][j] == 0 or A[i][j] == 1

Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int shortestBridge(vector<vector<int>>& A) {
        
    }
};
```

## 1236. Web Crawler

Given a url startUrl and an interface HtmlParser, implement a web crawler to crawl all links that are under the same hostname as startUrl. 

Return all urls obtained by your web crawler in any order.

Your crawler should:

- Start from the page: startUrl
- Call HtmlParser.getUrls(url) to get all urls from a webpage of given url.
- Do not crawl the same link twice.
- Explore only the links that are under the same hostname as startUrl.

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/08/13/urlhostname.png)

As shown in the example url above, the hostname is example.org. For simplicity sake, you may assume all urls use http protocol without any port specified. For example, the urls http://leetcode.com/problems and http://leetcode.com/contest are under the same hostname, while urls http://example.org/test and http://example.com/abc are not under the same hostname.

The HtmlParser interface is defined as such: 
```
interface HtmlParser {
  // Return a list of all urls from a webpage of given url.
  public List<String> getUrls(String url);
}
```
Below are two examples explaining the functionality of the problem, for custom testing purposes you'll have three variables urls, edges and startUrl. Notice that you will only have access to startUrl in your code, while urls and edges are not directly accessible to you in code.

 

Example 1:

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/10/23/sample_2_1497.png)
```
Input:
urls = [
  "http://news.yahoo.com",
  "http://news.yahoo.com/news",
  "http://news.yahoo.com/news/topics/",
  "http://news.google.com",
  "http://news.yahoo.com/us"
]
edges = [[2,0],[2,1],[3,2],[3,1],[0,4]]
startUrl = "http://news.yahoo.com/news/topics/"
Output: [
  "http://news.yahoo.com",
  "http://news.yahoo.com/news",
  "http://news.yahoo.com/news/topics/",
  "http://news.yahoo.com/us"
]
```
Example 2:

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/10/23/sample_3_1497.png)
```
Input: 
urls = [
  "http://news.yahoo.com",
  "http://news.yahoo.com/news",
  "http://news.yahoo.com/news/topics/",
  "http://news.google.com"
]
edges = [[0,2],[2,1],[3,2],[3,1],[3,0]]
startUrl = "http://news.google.com"
Output: ["http://news.google.com"]
Explanation: The startUrl links to all other pages that do not share the same hostname.
```

Constraints:

- 1 <= urls.length <= 1000
- 1 <= urls[i].length <= 300
- startUrl is one of the urls.
- Hostname label must be from 1 to 63 characters long, including the dots, may contain only the ASCII letters from 'a' to 'z', digits  from '0' to '9' and the hyphen-minus character ('-').
- The hostname may not start or end with the hyphen-minus character ('-'). 
- See:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hostname#Restrictions_on_valid_hostnames
- You may assume there're no duplicates in url library.

Solution:
```cpp
/**
 * // This is the HtmlParser's API interface.
 * // You should not implement it, or speculate about its implementation
 * class HtmlParser {
 *   public:
 *     vector<string> getUrls(string url);
 * };
 */

class Solution {
public:
    vector<string> crawl(string startUrl, HtmlParser htmlParser) {
        
    }
};
```

## 733. Flood Fill

An image is represented by a 2-D array of integers, each integer representing the pixel value of the image (from 0 to 65535).

Given a coordinate (sr, sc) representing the starting pixel (row and column) of the flood fill, and a pixel value newColor, "flood fill" the image.

To perform a "flood fill", consider the starting pixel, plus any pixels connected 4-directionally to the starting pixel of the same color as the starting pixel, plus any pixels connected 4-directionally to those pixels (also with the same color as the starting pixel), and so on. Replace the color of all of the aforementioned pixels with the newColor.

At the end, return the modified image.

Example 1:
```
Input: 
image = [[1,1,1],[1,1,0],[1,0,1]]
sr = 1, sc = 1, newColor = 2
Output: [[2,2,2],[2,2,0],[2,0,1]]
Explanation: 
From the center of the image (with position (sr, sc) = (1, 1)), all pixels connected 
by a path of the same color as the starting pixel are colored with the new color.
Note the bottom corner is not colored 2, because it is not 4-directionally connected
to the starting pixel.
```
Note:

- The length of image and image[0] will be in the range [1, 50].
- The given starting pixel will satisfy 0 <= sr < image.length and 0 <= sc < image[0].length.
- The value of each color in image[i][j] and newColor will be an integer in [0, 65535].

Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<int>> floodFill(vector<vector<int>>& image, int sr, int sc, int newColor) {
        
    }
};
```

## 515. Find Largest Value in Each Tree Row

You need to find the largest value in each row of a binary tree.

Example:
```
Input: 

          1
         / \
        3   2
       / \   \  
      5   3   9 

Output: [1, 3, 9]
```

Solution:
```cpp
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x, TreeNode *left, TreeNode *right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> largestValues(TreeNode* root) {
        
    }
};
```

## 968. Binary Tree Cameras

Given a binary tree, we install cameras on the nodes of the tree. 

Each camera at a node can monitor its parent, itself, and its immediate children.

Calculate the minimum number of cameras needed to monitor all nodes of the tree.

 

Example 1:

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/29/bst_cameras_01.png)
```
Input: [0,0,null,0,0]
Output: 1
Explanation: One camera is enough to monitor all nodes if placed as shown.
```
Example 2:

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/29/bst_cameras_02.png)

```
Input: [0,0,null,0,null,0,null,null,0]
Output: 2
Explanation: At least two cameras are needed to monitor all nodes of the tree. 
The above image shows one of the valid configurations of camera placement.
```

Note:

- The number of nodes in the given tree will be in the range [1, 1000].
- Every node has value 0.

## 971. Flip Binary Tree To Match Preorder Traversal

Given a binary tree with N nodes, each node has a different value from {1, ..., N}.

A node in this binary tree can be flipped by swapping the left child and the right child of that node.

Consider the sequence of N values reported by a preorder traversal starting from the root.  Call such a sequence of N values the voyage of the tree.

(Recall that a preorder traversal of a node means we report the current node's value, then preorder-traverse the left child, then preorder-traverse the right child.)

Our goal is to flip the least number of nodes in the tree so that the voyage of the tree matches the voyage we are given.

If we can do so, then return a list of the values of all nodes flipped.  You may return the answer in any order.

If we cannot do so, then return the list [-1].

 

Example 1:

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/01/02/1219-01.png)

```
Input: root = [1,2], voyage = [2,1]
Output: [-1]
```
Example 2:

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/01/02/1219-02.png)

```
Input: root = [1,2,3], voyage = [1,3,2]
Output: [1]
```
Example 3:

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/01/02/1219-02.png)

```
Input: root = [1,2,3], voyage = [1,2,3]
Output: []
```
 

Note:

- 1 <= N <= 100

Solution:
```cpp
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x, TreeNode *left, TreeNode *right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> flipMatchVoyage(TreeNode* root, vector<int>& voyage) {
        
    }
};
```


## 129. Sum Root to Leaf Numbers

Given a binary tree containing digits from 0-9 only, each root-to-leaf path could represent a number.

An example is the root-to-leaf path 1->2->3 which represents the number 123.

Find the total sum of all root-to-leaf numbers.

Note: A leaf is a node with no children.

Example:
```
Input: [1,2,3]
    1
   / \
  2   3
Output: 25
Explanation:
The root-to-leaf path 1->2 represents the number 12.
The root-to-leaf path 1->3 represents the number 13.
Therefore, sum = 12 + 13 = 25.
```
Example 2:
```
Input: [4,9,0,5,1]
    4
   / \
  9   0
 / \
5   1
Output: 1026
Explanation:
The root-to-leaf path 4->9->5 represents the number 495.
The root-to-leaf path 4->9->1 represents the number 491.
The root-to-leaf path 4->0 represents the number 40.
Therefore, sum = 495 + 491 + 40 = 1026.
```

Solution:
```cpp
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x, TreeNode *left, TreeNode *right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    int sumNumbers(TreeNode* root) {
        
    }
};
```

## 785. Is Graph Bipartite?

Given an undirected graph, return true if and only if it is bipartite.

Recall that a graph is bipartite if we can split it's set of nodes into two independent subsets A and B such that every edge in the graph has one node in A and another node in B.

The graph is given in the following form: graph[i] is a list of indexes j for which the edge between nodes i and j exists.  Each node is an integer between 0 and graph.length - 1.  There are no self edges or parallel edges: graph[i] does not contain i, and it doesn't contain any element twice.
```
Example 1:
Input: [[1,3], [0,2], [1,3], [0,2]]
Output: true
Explanation: 
The graph looks like this:
0----1
|    |
|    |
3----2
We can divide the vertices into two groups: {0, 2} and {1, 3}.
```
```
Example 2:
Input: [[1,2,3], [0,2], [0,1,3], [0,2]]
Output: false
Explanation: 
The graph looks like this:
0----1
| \  |
|  \ |
3----2
We cannot find a way to divide the set of nodes into two independent subsets.
 ```

Note:

- graph will have length in range [1, 100].
- graph[i] will contain integers in range [0, graph.length - 1].
- graph[i] will not contain i or duplicate values.
- The graph is undirected: if any element j is in graph[i], then i will be in graph[j].

Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool isBipartite(vector<vector<int>>& graph) {
        
    }
};
```

## 1145. Binary Tree Coloring Game


Two players play a turn based game on a binary tree.  We are given the root of this binary tree, and the number of nodes n in the tree.  n is odd, and each node has a distinct value from 1 to n.

Initially, the first player names a value x with 1 <= x <= n, and the second player names a value y with 1 <= y <= n and y != x.  The first player colors the node with value x red, and the second player colors the node with value y blue.

Then, the players take turns starting with the first player.  In each turn, that player chooses a node of their color (red if player 1, blue if player 2) and colors an uncolored neighbor of the chosen node (either the left child, right child, or parent of the chosen node.)

If (and only if) a player cannot choose such a node in this way, they must pass their turn.  If both players pass their turn, the game ends, and the winner is the player that colored more nodes.

You are the second player.  If it is possible to choose such a y to ensure you win the game, return true.  If it is not possible, return false.

 

Example 1:

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/08/01/1480-binary-tree-coloring-game.png)

```
Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11], n = 11, x = 3
Output: true
Explanation: The second player can choose the node with value 2.
 ```

Constraints:

- root is the root of a binary tree with n nodes and distinct node values from 1 to n.
- n is odd.
- 1 <= x <= n <= 100


## 559. Maximum Depth of N-ary Tree

Given a n-ary tree, find its maximum depth.

The maximum depth is the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.

Nary-Tree input serialization is represented in their level order traversal, each group of children is separated by the null value (See examples).

 

Example 1:

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/10/12/narytreeexample.png)
```
Input: root = [1,null,3,2,4,null,5,6]
Output: 3
```
Example 2:

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/11/08/sample_4_964.png)
```
Input: root = [1,null,2,3,4,5,null,null,6,7,null,8,null,
9,10,null,null,11,null,12,null,13,null,null,14]

Output: 5
 ```

Constraints:

- The depth of the n-ary tree is less than or equal to 1000.
- The total number of nodes is between [0, 10^4].

Solution:
```cpp
/*
// Definition for a Node.
class Node {
public:
    int val;
    vector<Node*> children;

    Node() {}

    Node(int _val) {
        val = _val;
    }

    Node(int _val, vector<Node*> _children) {
        val = _val;
        children = _children;
    }
};
*/

class Solution {
public:
    int maxDepth(Node* root) {
        
    }
};
```

## 802. Find Eventual Safe States

In a directed graph, we start at some node and every turn, walk along a directed edge of the graph.  If we reach a node that is terminal (that is, it has no outgoing directed edges), we stop.

Now, say our starting node is eventually safe if and only if we must eventually walk to a terminal node.  More specifically, there exists a natural number K so that for any choice of where to walk, we must have stopped at a terminal node in less than K steps.

Which nodes are eventually safe?  Return them as an array in sorted order.

The directed graph has N nodes with labels 0, 1, ..., N-1, where N is the length of graph.  The graph is given in the following form: graph[i] is a list of labels j such that (i, j) is a directed edge of the graph.

```
Example:
Input: graph = [[1,2],[2,3],[5],[0],[5],[],[]]
Output: [2,4,5,6]
Here is a diagram of the above graph.
```

![](https://s3-lc-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2018/03/17/picture1.png)

Note:

- graph will have length at most 10000.
- The number of edges in the graph will not exceed 32000.
- Each graph[i] will be a sorted list of different integers, chosen within the range [0, graph.length - 1].

Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> eventualSafeNodes(vector<vector<int>>& graph) {
        
    }
};
```

## 491. Increasing Subsequences

Given an integer array, your task is to find all the different possible increasing subsequences of the given array, and the length of an increasing subsequence should be at least 2.

 
```
Example:

Input: [4, 6, 7, 7]
Output: [[4, 6], [4, 7], [4, 6, 7], [4, 6, 7, 7], [6, 7], [6, 7, 7], [7,7], [4,7,7]]
``` 

Constraints:

- The length of the given array will not exceed 15.
- The range of integer in the given array is [-100,100].
- The given array may contain duplicates, and two equal integers should also be considered as a special case of increasing sequence.

Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<int>> findSubsequences(vector<int>& nums) {
        
    }
};
```
