## 761. Special Binary String

Special binary strings are binary strings with the following two properties:

The number of 0's is equal to the number of 1's.
Every prefix of the binary string has at least as many 1's as 0's.
Given a special string S, a move consists of choosing two consecutive, non-empty, special substrings of S, and swapping them. (Two strings are consecutive if the last character of the first string is exactly one index before the first character of the second string.)

At the end of any number of moves, what is the lexicographically largest resulting string possible?

Example 1:
```
Input: S = "11011000"
Output: "11100100"
Explanation:
The strings "10" [occuring at S[1]] and "1100" [at S[3]] are swapped.
This is the lexicographically largest string possible after some number of swaps.
```
Note:

- S has length at most 50.
- S is guaranteed to be a special binary string as defined above.

Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    string makeLargestSpecial(string S) {
        
    }
};
```

## 938. Range Sum of BST

Given the root node of a binary search tree, return the sum of values of all nodes with value between L and R (inclusive).

The binary search tree is guaranteed to have unique values.

 

Example 1:
```
Input: root = [10,5,15,3,7,null,18], L = 7, R = 15
Output: 32
```
Example 2:
```
Input: root = [10,5,15,3,7,13,18,1,null,6], L = 6, R = 10
Output: 23
```

Note:

- The number of nodes in the tree is at most 10000.
- The final answer is guaranteed to be less than 2^31.

Solution:
```cpp
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x, TreeNode *left, TreeNode *right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    int rangeSumBST(TreeNode* root, int L, int R) {
        
    }
};
```

## 894. All Possible Full Binary Trees

A full binary tree is a binary tree where each node has exactly 0 or 2 children.

Return a list of all possible full binary trees with N nodes.  Each element of the answer is the root node of one possible tree.

Each node of each tree in the answer must have node.val = 0.

You may return the final list of trees in any order.

 

Example 1:
```
Input: 7
Output: [
    [0,0,0,null,null,0,0,null,null,0,0],
    [0,0,0,null,null,0,0,0,0],
    [0,0,0,0,0,0,0],
    [0,0,0,0,0,null,null,null,null,0,0],
    [0,0,0,0,0,null,null,0,0]
]
Explanation:
```

Note:

- 1 <= N <= 20

Solution:
```cpp
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x, TreeNode *left, TreeNode *right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    vector<TreeNode*> allPossibleFBT(int N) {
        
    }
};
```

## 698. Partition to K Equal Sum Subsets

Given an array of integers nums and a positive integer k, find whether it's possible to divide this array into k non-empty subsets whose sums are all equal.

 

Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [4, 3, 2, 3, 5, 2, 1], k = 4
Output: True
Explanation: It's possible to divide it into 4 subsets 
(5), (1, 4), (2,3), (2,3) with equal sums.
```

Note:

- 1 <= k <= len(nums) <= 16.
- 0 < nums[i] < 10000.

Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool canPartitionKSubsets(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        
    }
};
```

## 687. Longest Univalue Path

Given a binary tree, find the length of the longest path where each node in the path has the same value. This path may or may not pass through the root.

The length of path between two nodes is represented by the number of edges between them.

 

Example 1:
```
Input:

              5
             / \
            4   5
           / \   \
          1   1   5
Output: 2
```
 

Example 2:
```
Input:

              1
             / \
            4   5
           / \   \
          4   4   5
Output: 2
```
 

Note: The given binary tree has not more than 10000 nodes. The height of the tree is not more than 1000.

Solution:
```cpp
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x, TreeNode *left, TreeNode *right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    int longestUnivaluePath(TreeNode* root) {
        
    }
};
```
